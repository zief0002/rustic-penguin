## Directions

Complete the problems on this worksheet with your break out group. You will have no more than 20 minutes.


## Problem Set I

Consider the distribution of the following six observations: $X = \{1, 2, 2,3,4,12\}$.


1. Plot these values. (Don't bother using R, just create a dot plot by hand.) 

2. Describe the shape of the distribution.

3. Compute the mean of the distribution.

4. Compute the standard deviation of the distribution.




# Problem Set II

Mean center the values of $X$ by subtracting the mean from each observation.


5. Plot the mean centered values. (Don't bother using R, just create a dot plot by hand.)

6. Describe the shape of the distribution.

7. Compute the mean of the distribution.

8. Compute the standard deviation of the distribution.




# Problem Set III

Standardize the values of $X$ (create $z$-scores) by subtracting the mean from each observation and dividing by the standard deviation.

5. Plot the standardized values. (Don't bother using R, just create a dot plot by hand.)

6. Describe the shape of the distribution.

7. Compute the mean of the distribution.

8. Compute the standard deviation of the distribution.
