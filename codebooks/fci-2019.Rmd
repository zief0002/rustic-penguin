Each season, [Team Marketing Report (TMR)](http://www.teammarketing.com/) computes the cost of taking a family of four to a professional sports contest for each of the major sporting leagues. Costs are determined by telephone calls with representatives of the teams, venues and concessionaires. Identical questions were asked in all interviews. Prices for Canadian teams were converted to U.S. dollars and comparison prices were converted using a recent exchange rate. Salary data were compiled from data collected by [Spotrac](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwig8rvjz-DmAhWLKs0KHRRMCBEQFjAAegQICBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spotrac.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1v4lZZ-vBr8wy_SvrzsoYZ).

The data in [fci-2019.csv](https://github.com/zief0002/epsy-8251/raw/master/data/fci-2019.csv) contains data from the 2018/2019 season for each of the $n=123$ teams that play in the four major North American men's sporting leagues. The attributes include:

- `team`: Name of professional sports team
- `fci`: Fan Cost Index (FCI). The FCI is a summary of what it costs to take a family of four to a game. It comprises the prices of four adult average-price tickets, two small draft beers, four small soft drinks, four regular-size hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs and two least expensive, adult-size adjustable caps.
- `league`: Major sporting league the team plays in (MLB = Major Lague Baseball; NBA = National Basketball Association; NFL = National Football League; NHL = National Hockey League)
- `payroll`: Team payroll for players on the active roster (in 100 million dollars)
