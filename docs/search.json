    "text": "Questions\n\nImport the data and display the first several rows of data (not all of it). Use one of the paged table options in your YAML to ensure that this is printed nicely. All syntax for these commands should be hidden.\nRecode the gni_class variable by creating a dummy variable called high_gni. To create this dummy variable use the syntax below. Explain in words (not code) how the high_gni dummy variable is being coded.\n\n\nfertility = fertility |>\n  mutate(\n    high_gni = if_else(gni_class == \"Upper/Middle\" | gni_class == \"Upper\", 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\nCreate a well-formatted table that includes the mean infant mortality rate and the standard deviation of infant mortality rates for each of the two High GNI levels represented in the data. Display these in a summary table. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption (the caption does not have to follow APA formatting). Do not display any syntax.\nUse the lm() function to fit a main effects linear model (unstandardized) regressing infant mortality on your dummy variable and female education level. Use the tidy() function from the broom package to display the model’s coefficient-level output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the model’s coefficient-level output.)\nUse a bulleted list to provide an interpretation of each estimated regression coefficient (including the intercept) from the regression you fitted in Question 3; one interpretation per list item.\nCreate a well-formatted table of the model’s coefficient tidy() output (e.g., using the gt() function from the {gt} package). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be “Predictor”, “B”, “SE”, “t”, and “p”, respectively. (The last four column names should be italicized since they are statistics.) All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the p-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add a caption. (2pts.)\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from the fitted model. For this plot, put the female education level predictor on the x-axis. Display separate lines to show the effects for each level of the dummy-coded GNI variable. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure includes a caption using the fig-cap option in the code chunk. The plot should be centered on the page. Adjust the aspect ratio of the plot using fig-width and fig-height in the code chunk so that it looks good. Lastly, change the values of the output width/height (out-width, out-height) to change the size of the plot from the default values. (2pts.)\nUse a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error and assumptions) using Greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from lm(). Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your document, and align the equals signs. (2pts.)\nWrite the following sentence: “The estimated partial regression coefficient (\\(\\hat\\beta_\\mathrm{Female~Education}\\)) is \\(x\\).” In this sentence, use an inline code chunk to replace \\(x\\) with the value for the fitted coefficient from the fitted equation. In this code chunk, do not just write in the value for the coefficient, but use syntax to extract the value from the tidy() output. (Hint: Google “R extract element from dataframe”.) (2pts.)\nCompute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the anova() function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, \\(\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Show the syntax you used in your document.\nWrite a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your document. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.) Both the BIB and CSL files should be included in your project’s assets directory. (2pts.)"

In this study, we will fit the same candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, however we will be using a different data set (e.g., our data includes more regions than Snipes and Taylor’s data). We will also make one change in the analysis, and that is we will treat vintage as a continuous variable; we won’t categorize it like Snipes and Taylor did. By using a different set of data and making slightly different analytic decisions we can more vigorously evaluate the underlying working hypotheses.\nFit the same nine candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, using the wine.csv data. In these models use wine rating (rating) as the outcome. Remember to treat vintage as a continuous variable in the models that include it.

    "text": "Effect of Religious Service Attendance\nYou will begin the analysis by examining the effect of religious service attendance on support of same-sex marriage. Because the data for this predictor come from a Likert scale (ordinal in nature), we need to examine whether we can treat it as a continuous predictor in the model, or whether we should treat it as categorical.\n\nBegin by computing the empirical proportion of people that support same-sex marriage for each of the attendance categories. Create a line plot that shows the relationship between proportion of support and attendance.\n\nBased on the plot you just created, the relationship between proportion of support and attendance seems linear. Because of this, we can treat the Likert data as continuous; using a line (or polynomial) to fit the relationship. The only caution being that when interpreting a slope, we say something like, “a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)-unit difference in \\(Y\\)”. For ordinal (Likert) data a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) really indicates a shift from one category to the next highest category.\n\nFit two logistic models to the data using religious service attendance. In the first model, only include the linear effect of attendance. In the second model, include both a linear and quadratic effect to predict variation in support for same-sex marriage. Which model should be adopted (linear or quadratic)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (Note: The model you adopt here will be henceforth referred to as Model 1.)\n\n\n\n\nWrite the fitted equation for Model 1. (Don’t forget to include all appropriate subscripts. Also define any terms in the model that are ambiguous.)\nUse the fitted equation for Model 1 to predict the (a) log-odds, (b) odds, and (c) probability of someone supporting same-sex marriage if that person attends religious services almost every week."

By referring to this matrix, clearly indicate the order in which you will add covariates into the model.\n\nFit three logistic models based on the order of importance of the three covariates that also include the effects of religious attendance, and denomination. For example, the first of these three models would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the most important covariate you identifed in Question 8. The second model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the two most important covariates you identified. Finally, the third model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and all three covariates.\n\nWhich of these three models should be adopted as you final model (or set of models)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (2pts.)\nCreate a table of results from your set of fitted models. This table should include Models 1–3 and also any model(s) you adopted from the previous question. Like other regression tables you have created, be sure to include the estimated coefficients and standard errors for each of the effects included in the models.

This is a general function that allows us to customize many parts of the table (akin to theme() in ggplot()).\nTo do this we use the style= argument and call the cell_borders() function within tab_style(). Here we remove all borders (top, bottom, left, and right) by using sides=\"all\" and setting style=NULL. The tab_style() function also requires the argument locations=. We give this argument the function cell_body() which we provide the column and row numbers that we want to remove the borders from.

Then create a code chunk in which you create a scatterplot of infant mortality rates (y-axis) versus female education level (x-axis).\n\n\nIt is a good idea to include a label in the chunk options for each plot you create. A label is the name of this code chunk. (Any code chunk, even if it is not a plot, can have a label.) In the plot below, the chunk’s label is fig-scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that by labeling this chunk, the figure is numbered in the document. We also added a caption using the fig-cap: option.\n\n\nFigure Size\nThere are a couple other chunk options for figures that help set the aspect ratio and size of the figure in your document. The aspect ratio is the ratio of a figure’s width to its height. We set this using the fig-width: and fig-height: chunk options. (The default value for both is 6; thus the figure appears square.) Below we change these so that the figure appears wider than it is tall.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-2\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to change the aspect ratio when you have legends or when you are using {patchwork} to stack or put multiple figures next to each other. Many times you need to find a good aspect ratio though trial-and-error of trying different values.\n\nThe actual size of the figure in the document is independent of the aspect ratio and can be set using the out-width: or out-height: chunk option. These options take a character string of the direct size (in HTML documents this is typically in pixels) or of the percentage of the output width/height. Here we keep the same aspect ratio, but make the figure smaller by setting the figure width to 40% of the document’s width.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-3\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| out-width: \"40%\"\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set the aspect ratio of the figure, you need only set out-width: or out-height:. You don’t need to set both as the other will be determined by the aspect ratio."

For example, consider writing the following sentence in an analysis of the fertility.csv data.\n\nThe mean infant mortality rate is 26.05% (SD = 23.98).\n\nRather than computing these values and then transposing the values into the sentence, we can use inline code chunks to directly compute and write the values in the sentence. Here is some syntax we could use:\nThe mean infant mortality rate is `r mean(fertility$infant_mortality)` (SD = `r sd(fertility$infant_mortality)`).\nThis produces the following sentence in the rendered document:\n\nThe mean infant mortality rate is 26.05 (SD = 23.982719).\n\n\n\nRounding\nThere are several ways to set the rounding to two decimal places. One is to embed the computation in the round() function. For example, in the first inline chunk we could use: round(mean(fertility$infant_mortality), 2).\nYou can also do this in a separate code chunk and then call the values in the inline computation (as suggested in the Quarto Computations Tutorial)."

    "text": "Better Typesetting of Equations\nWhen we typeset equations, there are a couple things we should do:\n\nUse variable names that make sense to our reader, rather than their name in our dataset/R. For example “Female Education Level” is a better name than “educ_female”.\n\nThis means we will need to add spaces into our variable names in the mathematical expression. If you tried that earlier, you found out that just hitting the spacebar does not produce a space in the outputted expression. We need to include a tilde (~) every time you want a space. So to get the name “Female Education Level” we need to use the following in our equation:\n$$\nFemale~Education~Level\n$$\n\nVariable names should also be typeset using normal text rather than italic (the default in mathematical expressions).\n\nTo achieve this, we have to embed the text we want to be normal in the syntax \\mathrm{}. This typesets the text in a roman font (normal text). For example:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Female~Education~Level}\n$$\nYou can also use \\mathit{} (italics), \\mathbf{} (bold), \\mathtt{} (typewriter text), and \\mathcal{} (caligraphy; this is useful for the “N” we use to indicate a normal distribution).\n\nHyphens need special syntax since a hyphen would be interpreted as a minus sign. In typesetting, the minus sign is longer than the hyphen symbol.\n\nIf you want to include a hyphen, we need to include it in \\mbox{}. For example, to add a hyphen in our variable name to get “Female Education-Level”, we use:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Female~Education\\mbox{-}Level}\n$$\n\nUpdate your fitted equation from before to include spaces in variable names. Also be sure the variable names are written in normal font."

    "text": "Log-Likelihood\nThe likelihood values are quite small since we are multiplying several probability densities (values between 0 and 1) together. Since it is hard to work with these smaller values, in practice, we often compute and work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood. So in our example, \\(\\mathcal{L}_1 = 4.71647 \\times 10^{-50}\\) and the log-likelihood would be:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 1\nlog(4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] -113.5782\n\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the log-likelihood for Model 2 as:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 2\nlog(5.231164e-48)\n\n[1] -108.8695\n\n\nWe typically denote log-likelihood using a scripted lower-case “l” (\\(\\mathcal{l}\\)). Here,\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{l}_1 &= -113.5782 \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathcal{l}_2 &= -108.8695 \\\\[1ex]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNote that the logarithm of a decimal will be negative, so the log-likelihood will be a negative value. Less negative log-likelihood values correspond to higher likelihood values, which indicate more empirical support. Here Model 2 has a less negative log-likelihood value (\\(-108\\)) than Model 1 (\\(-113\\)), which indicates there is more empirical support for Model 2 than Model 1.\nWe can also express the likelihood ratio using log-likelihoods. To do so we take the natural logarithm of the likelihood ratio. We also re-write it using the rules of logarithms from algebra.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln(\\mathrm{LR}) &= \\ln \\bigg(\\frac{\\mathcal{L}_2}{\\mathcal{L}_1}\\bigg) \\\\[2ex]\n&= \\ln \\big(\\mathcal{L}_2\\big) - \\ln \\big(\\mathcal{L}_1\\big)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThat is, we can find an equivalent relative support metric to the LR based on the log-likelihoods by computing the difference between them. For our example:\n\n# Difference in log-likelihoods\nlog(5.231164e-48) - log(4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] 4.708743\n\n# Equivalent to ln(LR)\nlog(5.231164e-48 / 4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] 4.708743\n\n\nUnfortunately, this difference doesn’t have the same interpretational value as the LR does, bcause this difference is in log-units. In order to get that interpretation back, we need to exponentiate (the reverse function of the logarithm) the difference:\n\n# Exponentiate the difference in log-likelihoods\nexp(4.708743)\n\n[1] 110.9127\n\n\nModel 2 has 110.9 times the empirical support than Model 1.\n\nMathematics of Log-Likelihood\nWe can express the log-likelihood of the regression residuals mathematically by taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood we computed earlier:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln \\Bigl(\\mathcal{L}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data})\\Bigr) &= \\ln \\Biggl( \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\right]^n \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_1^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\times  \\\\\n&~~~~~~ \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_2^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\times \\ldots \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_n^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\Biggr) \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nUsing our rules for logarithms and re-arranging gives,\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\epsilon_i^2\n\\]\nExamining this equation, we see that the log-likelihood is a function of \\(n\\), \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) and the sum of squared residuals (SSR)1. We can of course, re-express this using the the regression parameters:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\big[Y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1(X_i)\\big]^2\n\\]\nAnd, again, since \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) is a function of the regression coefficients and \\(n\\), this means that the only variables in the log-likelihood function are the coefficients."

    "text": "Shortcut: The logLik() Function\nThe logLik() function can be used to obtain the log-likelihood directly from a fitted model object. For example, to find the log-likelihood for Model 1, we can use:\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 1\nlogLik(lm.1)\n\n'log Lik.' -113.5472 (df=3)\n\n\nThe df output tells us how many total parameters are being estimated in the model. In our case this is three (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{SAT}}\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). What is more important to us currently, is the log-likelihood value; \\(\\mathcal{l}_1=-113.55\\).\nThis value is slightly different than the log-likelihood we just computed of \\(-113.58\\). This is not because of rounding in this case. It has to do with how the model is being estimated; the logLik() function assumes the parameters are being estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS). We will learn more about this in the next set of notes, but for now, we will just use logLik() to compute the log-likelihood.\nHere we compute the log-likelihood for Model 2 using the logLik() function. We also use the output to compute the likelihood, and the likelihood ratio between Model 2 and Model 1\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 2\nlogLik(lm.2)\n\n'log Lik.' -108.7964 (df=4)\n\n# Compute likelihood for Model 2\nexp(logLik(lm.2)[1])\n\n[1] 5.627352e-48\n\n# Compute LR\nexp( logLik(lm.2)[1] - logLik(lm.1)[1] )\n\n[1] 115.6734\n\n\nBecause the output from logLik() includes extraneous information (e.g., df), we use indexing (square brackets) to extract only the part of the output we want. In this case, the [1] extracts the log-likelihood value from the logLik() output (ignoring the df part).\nAlso of note is that the df for Model 2 is four, indicating that this model is estimating four parameters (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{SAT}}\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{Sector}}\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). The value of df in the logLik() output is a quantification of the model’s complexity. Here Model 2 (df = 4) is more complex than Model 1 (df = 3).\nAs we consider using the likelihood ratio (LR) or the difference in log-likelihoods for model selection, we also need to consider the model complexity. In our example, the likelihood ratio of 115.7 (computed using logLik()) indicates that Model 2 has approximately 116 times the empirical support than Model 1. But, Model 2 is more complex than Model 1, so we would expect that it would be more empirically supported.\nIn this case, with a LR of 116, it seems like the data certainly support adopting Model 2 over Model 1, despite the added complexity of Model 2. But what if the LR was 10? Would that be enough additional support to warrant adopting Model 2 over Model 1? What about a LR of 5?"

For example, in our standard normal distribution outcomes near zero are more probable than outcomes near 1, which are more probable than outcomes near 2, etc. Since we can’t use probability to do this (remember the probability of each outcome is the same, namely 0), we use something called probability density. This is akin to a relative probability, so outcomes with a higher probability density are more likely than outcomes with a lower probability density.\nThe mapping of all the outcomes to their probability densities is called a probability density function (PDF). Thus the equation or “bell-shaped” curve describing the standard normal distribution in Figure 1 is technically a PDF Here are some laws governing PDFs:\n\nProbability densities are always positive.\nThe probability of an outcome x between a and b equals the integral (area under the curve) between a and b of the probability density function.

    "section": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density",
    "text": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density\nThe function pnorm() computes the area under the PDF curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to some x-value. (Sometimes this is referred to as the cumulative probability density of x.) It is important to note that the PDF is defined such that the entire area under the curve is equal to 1. Because of this, we can also think about using area under the curve as an analog to probability in a continuous distribution.\nFor example, we might ask about the probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 given it is from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. Symbolically, we want to find:\n\\[\nP\\bigg(x \\leq 65 \\mid \\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\bigg)\n\\]\nThis is akin to finding the proportion of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) PDF that is to the left of 65. The figure below shows a graphical depiction of the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Create dataset\nfig_03 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = 10, to = 90, by = 0.01)\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n    )\n\n# Filter out X<=65\nshaded = fig_03 %>%\n  filter(X <= 65)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_03, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shaded, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"X\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. The area that is shaded grey (relative to the total area under the PDF) represents the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\n\n\nWe can compute the cumulative probability density using the pnorm() function. The “p” stand for “probability”.\n\n# Find P(x<=65 | N(50,10) )\npnorm(q = 65, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n\nWe can interpret this as:\n\nThe probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 (if it is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) is 0.933.\n\nIn mathematics, the area under a curve is called an integral. The grey-shaded area in the previous figure can also be expressed as an integral of the probability density function:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{65} p(x) dx\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(x)\\) is the PDF for the normal distribution.\nThe most common application for finding the cumulative density is to compute a p-value. The p-value is just the area under the distribution (curve) that is AT LEAST as extreme as some observed value. For example, assume we computed a test statistic of \\(z=2.5\\), and were evaluating whether this was different from 0 (two-tailed test). Graphically, we want to determine the proportion of the area under the PDF that is shaded grey in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n# Create data\nfig_04 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01)\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n    )\n\n# Filter data for shading\nshade_01 = fig_04 %>%\n  filter(X >= 2.5)\n\nshade_02 = fig_04 %>%\n  filter(X <= -2.5)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_04, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_01, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_02, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"z\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for the standard normal distribution (\\(M=0\\), \\(SD=1\\)). The cumulative density representing the p-value for a two-tailed test evaluating whether \\(\\mu=0\\) using an observed mean of 2.5 is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the distribution of the test statistic is normally distributed, we can use pnorm() to compute the p-value. If we assume the test statistic, z, has been scaled to use standardized units, the standard deviation we use in pnorm() will be sd=1. The mean is based on the value being tested in the null hypothesis. In most null hypotheses, we are testing a difference from 0 (e.g., \\(H_0: \\mu=0\\), \\(H_0: \\beta=0\\)), so we would use mean=0 in the pnorm() function.\nRemember, pnorm() computes the proportion of the area under the curve TO THE LEFT of a particular value. Here we will compute the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) and then double it to produce the actual p-value. (We can double it because the normal distribution is symmetric so the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) is the same as the area to the right of \\(+2.5\\).)\n\n# Compute the p-value based on z=2.5\n2 * pnorm(q = -2.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.01241933\n\n\nWe interpret this p-value as:\n\nThe probability of observing a statistic at least as extreme as 2.5, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 0.012. This is evidence against the null hypothesis since the data are inconsistent with the assumed hypothesis.\n\n\n\nqnorm(): Computing Quantiles\nThe qnorm() function is essentially the inverse of the pnorm() function. The pnorm() function computes the cumulative probability GIVEN a particular quantile (x-value). The qnorm() function computes the quantile GIVEN a cumulative probability. For example, in the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) distribution, half of the area under the PDF is below the x-value (quantile) of 50.\nTo use the qnorm() function to give the x-value (quantile) that defines the lower 0.5 of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) PDF, the syntax would be:\n\n# Find the quantile that has a cumulative density of 0.5 in the N(50, 10) distribution\nqnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\n\nrnorm(): Generating Random Observations\nThe rnorm() function can be used to generate random observations drawn from a specified normal distribution. Aside from the mean= and sd= arguments, we also need to specify the number of observations to generate by including the argument n=. For example, to generate 15 observations drawn from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution we would use the following syntax:\n\n# Generate 15 observations from N(50,10)\nset.seed(100)\nrnorm(n = 15, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n [1] 44.97808 51.31531 49.21083 58.86785 51.16971 53.18630 44.18209 57.14533\n [9] 41.74741 46.40138 50.89886 50.96274 47.98366 57.39840 51.23380\n\n\nThe set.seed() function sets the state of the random number generator used in R so that the results are reproducible. If you don’t use set.seed() you will get a different set of observations each time you run rnorm(). Here we set the starting seed to 100, but you can set this to any integer you want."

    "text": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates\nMean squares are also estimates of the variance. Consider the computational formula for the sample variance,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum(Y - \\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nThis is the total sum of squares divided by the total df. The variance of the outcome variable is interpreted as the average amount of variation in the outcome variable (in the squared metric). Thus, it is also referred to as the mean square total.\nWhen we compute an F-statistic, we are finding the ratio of two different variance estimates—one based on the model (explained variance) and one based on the error (unexplained variance). Under the null hypothesis that \\(\\rho^2 = 0\\), we are assuming that all the variance is unexplained. In that case, our F-statistic would be close to zero. When the model explains a significant amount of variation, the numerator gets larger relative to the denominator and the F-value is larger.\nThe mean squared error (from the anova() output) plays a special role in regression analysis. It is the variance estimate for the conditional distributions of the residuals in our visual depiction of the distributional assumptions of the residuals underlying linear regression.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Visual Depiction of the Distributional Assumptions of the Residuals Underlying Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we made implicit assumptions about the conditional distributions of the residuals, namely that they were identically and normally distributed with a mean of zero and some variance. Based on the estimate of the mean squared error, the variance of each of these distributions is 58.5.\nWhile the variance is a mathematical convenience, the standard deviation is often a better descriptor of the variation in a distribution since it is measured in the original metric. The standard deviation fro the residuals (error) is 7.6. Because the residuals are statistics (summaries computed from sample data), their standard deviation is referred to as a “standard error”.\n\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is sometimes referred to as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n\n# Compute RMSE\nsqrt(58.5)\n\n[1] 7.648529\n\n\nWhy is this value important? It gives the expected variation in the conditional residual distributions, which is a measure of the average amount of error. For example, since all of the conditional distributions of the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed, we would expect that 95% of the residuals would fall between \\(\\pm2\\) standard errors from 0; or, in this case, between \\(-15.3\\) and \\(+15.3\\). Observations with residuals that are more extreme may be regression outliers.\nMore importantly, it is a value that we need to estimate in order to specify the model."

    "text": "Residual Plot: Another Way to Spot Nonlinearity\nSometimes, the nonlinear relationship is difficult to detect from the scatterplot of Y versus X. Often it helps to fit the linear model and then examine the assumption of linearity in the residuals. It is sometimes easier to detect nonlinearity in the scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted values.\n\n# Fit linear model\nlm.1 = lm(grad ~ 1 + sat, data = mn)\n\n# Residual plot: Scatterplot\nresidual_plots(lm.1, type = \"s\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standardized residuals versus the fitted values for a model regressing six-year graduation rates on median SAT scores. The line \\(Y=0\\) (black) and the loess smoother (blue) are also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThis plot suggests that the assumption of linearity may be violated; the average residual is not zero at each fitted value. For low fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be less than zero, for moderate fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be more than zero, and for high fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be less than zero.\nNotice that the pattern displayed in the residuals is consistent with the pattern of the observed data in the initial scatterplot (Figure 1). If we look at the data relative to the regression smoother we see that there is not even vertical scatter around this line. At low and high SAT scores the observed data tends to be below the regression line (the regression is over-estimating the average graduation rate), while for moderate SAT scores the observed data tends to be above the regression line (the regression is under-estimating the average graduation rate)."

    "text": "Are the Assumptions More Tenable for this Model?\nMore important than whether the p-value is small, is whether including the quadratic effect improved the assumption violation we noted earlier. To evaluate this, we will examine the two residual plots for the quadratic model: (1) a density plot of the standardized residuals; and (2) a plot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values.\n\n# Residual plots\nresidual_plots(lm.2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Residual plots for the quadratic model regressing six-year graduation rate on median SAT scores. LEFT: Density plot of the standardized residuals. The confidence envelope for a normal reference distribution (blue shaded area) is also displayed. RIGHT: Standardized residuals versus the fitted values. The line \\(Y=0\\) (black) and confidence envelope (grey shaded area) for that line are shown, along with the loess smoother (blue) esimating the mean pattern of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values suggests that the residuals for the quadratic model are far better behaved; indicating much more consistency with the assumption that the average residual is zero at each fitted value than the linear model. This is the evidence that we would use to justify retaining the quadratic effect in the model. This plot also suggests that the homoskedasticity assumption is tenable. Finally, the empirical density of the residuals also seems consistent with the assumption of normality for this model.\nReminder: The assumption of independence can’t be evaluated from the plots, but is vary important given we rely on it to be able to correctly compute the likelihood. From the design of the study, we haven’t sampled the schools randomly, nor randomly assigned the schools to their levels of the predictor(s), so we can’t infer independence from that. So the question becomes, does knowing the graduation rate of a school in the population give us information about the graduation rate for other schools in the population with the same median SAT score? If the answer is “no”, then we can call the independence assumption tenable. If the answer is “yes”, the independence assumption is violated and we should not use the lm() function or believe that results from that function are valid."

    "text": "Graphical Interpretation\nTo plot the fitted equation, we use the geom_function() layer to add the fitted curve. (Note that we can no longer use geom_abline() since the addition of the polynomial effect implies that a line is no longer suitable.) This layer takes the argument fun= which describes a function that will be plotted as a line. To describe a function, use the syntax function(){...}. Here we use this syntax to describe the function of x (which in the ggplot() global layer is mapped to the sat variable). The fitted equation is then also written in terms of x and placed inside the curly braces. (Note that it is best to be more exact in the coefficient values—don’t round—when you create this plot as even minor differences can grossly change the plot.)\n\n# Scatterplot\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = function(x) {-366.34 + 62.72*x - 2.15 * x^2},\n    color = \"#0072b2\"\n    ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scatterplot of six-year graduation rate versus median SAT score. The fitted curve from the quadratic regression model (blue line) is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThe fitted curve helps us interpret the nature of the relationship between median SAT scores and graduation rates. The effect of median SAT score on graduation rate depends on SAT score (definition of an interaction). For schools with low SAT scores, the effect of SAT score on graduation rate is positive and fairly high. For schools with high SAT scores, the effect of SAT score on graduation rate remains positive, but it has a smaller effect on graduation rates; the effect diminishes."

    "section": "Algebraic Interpretation",
    "text": "Algebraic Interpretation\nFrom algebra, you may remember that the coefficient in front of the quadratic term (\\(-2.2\\)) informs us of whether the quadratic is an upward-facing U-shape, or a downward-facing U-shape. Since our term is negative, the U-shape is downward-facing. This is consistent with what we saw in the plot. What the algebra fails to show is that, within the range of SAT scores in our data, we only see part of the entire downward U-shape.\nThis coefficient also indicates whether the U-shape is skinny or wide. Although “skinny” and “wide” are only useful as relative comparisons. Algebraically, the comparison is typically to a quadratic coefficient of 1, which is generally not useful in our interpretation. The intercept and coefficient for the linear term help us locate the U-shape in the coordinate plane (moving it right, left, up, or down from the origin). You could work all of this out algebraically.\n\nYou can see how different values of these coefficients affect the curve on Wikipedia. Here is an interactive graph that lets you explore how changing the different coefficients changes the parabola.\n\nWhat can be useful is to find where the minimum (upward facing U-shape) or maximum (downward facing U-shape) occurs. This point is referred to as the vertex of the parabola and can be algebraically determined. To do this we determine the x-location of the vertex by\n\\[\nx_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1}{2 \\times \\hat\\beta_2}\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) is the estimated coefficient for the linear term and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_2\\) is the estimated coefficient for the quadratic term. The y coordinate for the vertex can then be found by substituting the x-coordinate into the fitted equation. For our example,\n\\[\nx_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -\\frac{62.72}{2 \\times -2.15} = 14.58\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ny_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -366.34 + 62.72(14.58) - 2.15(14.58^2) = 91.08\n\\]\nThis suggests that at a median SAT score of 1458 we predict a six-year graduate rate of 91.08. This x-value also represents the value at which the direction of the effect changes. In our example recall that for higher values of SAT the effect of SAT on graduation rate was diminishing. This is true for schools with median SAT scores up to 1458. For schools with higher SAT scores the effect of SAT score on graduation rate would theoretically be negative, and would be more negative for higher values.\nThis is all theoretical as our data only includes median SAT scores up to 1400. Everything past that value (including the vertex) is extrapolation. Extrapolation is exceedingly sketchy when we start fitting non-linear models. For example, do we really think that the average graduation rate for schools with a median SAT scores higher than 1458 would actually be smaller than for schools at 1458? It is more likely that the effect just flattens out."

The residual standard error for Model 4, \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=5.64\\), has also decreased from that for Model 3 indicating that this model has less error than Model 3.\nThe coefficient-level output is:\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.4)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can use this to obtain the fitted equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} = -&413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i) + \\\\\n&35.07(\\mathrm{Public}_i) - 4.11(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(\\mathrm{Public}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe interaction tells us that the effect of SAT on graduation rate differs for public and private institutions. Rather than parsing this difference by trying to interpret each of the effects, we will again plot the fitted curves for private and public institutions, and use the plot to aid our interpretation.\nPrivate Institutions\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} &= -413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i) + 35.07(0) - 4.11(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(0) \\\\\n&= -413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nPublic Institutions\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} &= -413.80 + 71.65(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i) + 35.07(1) - 4.11(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(1) \\\\\n&= -378.73 + 67.54(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) - 2.54(\\mathrm{SAT}^2_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nComparing these two fitted equations, we see that not only is the intercept in the two fitted models different (due to the main effect of sector), but now the coefficient for the interaction between sector and the linear effect of SAT also differs; it is lower for public institutions (by 4.11 units) than for private institutions. The quadratic effect of SAT is the same for both public and private institutions. (If we had adopted the model with both interaction terms, the quadratic effect would also be different across sectors.)\nTo visualize the effect of SAT, we can again plot each fitted curve by including each in a separate geom_function() layer.\n\n# Plot of the fitted model\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0) +\n    geom_function(\n      fun = function(x) {-378.73 + 67.54 * x - 2.54 * x^2},\n      color = \"#2ec4b6\",\n      linetype = \"dashed\"\n      ) +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = function(x) {-413.80 + 71.65 * x - 2.54 * x^2},\n    color = \"#ff9f1c\",\n    linetype = \"solid\"\n    ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Six-year graduation rate as a function of median SAT score for private (orange, solid line) and public (blue, dashed line) institutions.\n\n\n\n\nThe curvature (linear and quadratic slopes) of the lines now looks different for the two sectors because of the interaction term. (Note that interactions with the linear effect of SAT or the quadratic effect of SAT contribute to a change in the curvature.) For both sectors, the effect of median SAT on graduation rates is positive (institutions with higher median SAT scores tend to have higher graduation rates. But, this effect diminishes for institutions with increasingly higher SAT scores. Private schools have higher graduation rates, on average, than public schools for all levels of median SAT score. Moreover, this difference in graduation rates is getting larger at higher levels of SAT (that is the interaction!)."

    "text": "Example 2: Using MLE to Estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation\nIn the previous example, we assumed that we knew the value for \\(\\sigma\\). In practice, this often needs to be estimates along with \\(\\mu\\). To do this, you need to set up a search space that includes different combinations of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Here we search \\(\\mu = \\{10.0, 10.1, 10.2,\\ldots, 30.0\\}\\) and \\(\\sigma=\\{0.0, 0.1, 0.2,\\ldots,10.0\\}\\) values from 0.1 to 10.0. (Remember, that \\(\\sigma\\geq0\\)).\nThe crossing() function creates every combination of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) that we define in our search space. So, for example, [\\(\\mu=10.0; \\sigma=0.0\\)], ]\\(\\mu=10.0; \\sigma=0.1\\)], [\\(\\mu=10.0; \\sigma=0.2\\)], etc. Since we have included 201 \\(\\mu\\) values and 101 \\(\\sigma\\) values, the search space is \\(201 \\times 101 = 20,301\\) parameter combinations.\n\n# Set up search space\n# Compute the likelihood\nexample_02 = crossing(\n  mu = seq(from = 10, to = 30, by = 0.1),\n  sigma = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 0.1)\n  ) |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  mutate(\n    L = prod(dnorm(c(30, 20, 24, 27), mean = mu, sd = sigma))\n    ) |>\n  ungroup()\n\n# Find row with highest likelihood\nexample_02 |>\n  slice_max(L, n = 1)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe parameters that maximize the likelihood (in our search space) are a mean of 25.2 and a standard deviation of 3.7. Again, if you need to be more precise in these estimates, you can increase the precision in the by= argument of the seq() functions.\nIn computer science, this method for finding the MLE is referred to as a grid search. This is because the combinations of parameter values in the search space constitute a grid. In the figure below, the search space for each parameter is listed in the first row/column of the table. Every other cell of the table (the “grid”) constitutes a particular combination of the parameters. We are then computing the likelihood for each combination of parameters and searching for the cell with the highest likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Grid showing the combinations of parameter values used in the search space.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have two (or more) parameters we need to estimate the time taken to carry out a grid search is increased in a non-linear way. For example, combining 100 values of each parameter does not result in a search space of 200, but a search space of 10,000. So increasing the precision of both parameters to by=.01 increases each the number of candidates from \\(20,301\\) to \\(2001 \\times 1001 = 2,003,001\\). This increase the computational time it takes to solve the problem.\nIf you are relying on grid search, it is often better to operate with less precision initially, and then identify smaller parts of the grid that can be searched with more precision.\n\n\n\nLikelihood Profile for Multiple Parameters\nWe could also plot the profile of the likelihood for our search space, but this time there would be three dimensions: one dimension for \\(\\mu\\) (x-axis), one dimension for \\(\\sigma\\) (y-axis), and one dimension for the likelihood (z-axis). When we plot the likelihood profile across both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), the profile looks like an asymmetrical mountain. The highest likelihood value is at the summit of the mountain and corresponds to \\(\\mu=25.2\\) and \\(\\sigma=3.7\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Load library\nlibrary(plot3D)\n\nscatter3D(x = example_02$mu, y = example_02$sigma, z = example_02$L, \n          pch = 18, cex = 2, theta = 45, phi = 20, ticktype = \"detailed\",\n          xlab = expression(mu), ylab = expression(sigma), zlab = \"Likelihood\",\n          colkey = FALSE,\n          colvar = example_02$L,\n          col = ramp.col(col = c(\"#f6eff7\", \"#bdc9e1\", \"#67a9cf\", \"#1c9099\", \"#016c59\"), n = 100, alpha = 1)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Likelihood profile for the search space of both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) assuming a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\nIf we extend our estimation to three or more parameters, we can still use the computational search to find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), but it would be difficult to plot (there would be four or more dimensions). In general, the profile plots are more useful as a pedagogical tool rather than as a way of actually finding the MLEs."

The biggest is that you would not have any idea which values of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) to limit the search space to. Essentially you would need to search an infinite number of values unless you could limit the search space in some way. For many common methods (e.g., linear regression) finding the ML estimates is mathematically pretty easy (if we know calculus; see the section Using Calculus to Determine the MLEs). For more complex methods (e.g., mixed-effect models) there is not a mathematical solution. Instead, mathematics is used to help limit the search space and then a grid search is used to hone in on the estimates.\nAlthough not a complication, we made an assumption about the value of the residual standard error, that it was equivalent to sigma(errors). In practice, this value would also need to be estimated, along with the coefficients."

    "section": "Estimating the Residual Variation: Maximum Likelihood vs. Ordinary Least Squares",
    "text": "Estimating the Residual Variation: Maximum Likelihood vs. Ordinary Least Squares\nThe estimates of the residual standard error differ because the two estimation methods use different criteria to optimize over; OLS estimation finds the estimates that minimize the sum of squared errors, and ML finds the estimates that maximize the likelihood. Because of the differences, it is important to report how the model was estimated in any publication.\nBoth estimation methods have been well studied, and the resulting residual standard error from these estimation methods can be computed directly once we have the coefficient estimates (which are the same for both methods). Namely, the residual standard error resulting from OLS estimation is:\n\\[\n\\hat\\sigma_{\\epsilon}= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i\\right)^2}{n-p-1}}\n\\]\nwhere p is the number of predictors in the model. And the residual standard error resulting from ML estimation is:\n\\[\n\\hat\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i\\right)^2}{n}},\n\\]\nThe smaller denominator from the OLS estimate produces a higher overall estimate of the residual variation (more uncertainty). When n is large, the differences between the OLS and ML estimates of the residual standard error are minimal and can safely be ignored. When n is small, however, these differences can impact statistical results. For example, since the residual standard error is used to compute the standard error estimates for the coefficients, the choice of ML or OLS will have an effect on the size of the t- and p-values for the coefficients. (In practice, it is rare to see the different estimation methods producing substantively different findings, especially when fitting general linear models.)\nLastly, we note that the value of log-likelihood is the same for both the ML and OLS estimated models. The result from the ML output was:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n-2 \\ln(\\mathrm{Likelihood}) &= 78.91 \\\\[1ex]\n\\ln(\\mathrm{Likelihood}) &= -39.45\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe log-likelihood for the OLS estimated model is:\n\n# Log-likelihood for OLS model\nlogLik(lm(y ~ 1 + x))\n\n'log Lik.' -39.45442 (df=3)\n\n\nThis is a very useful result. It allows us to use lm() to estimate the coefficients from a model and then use its log-likelihood value in the same way as if we had fitted the model using ML. This will be helpful when we compute measure such as information criteria later in the course.\n\nIn many applications of estimation, it is useful to use a criterion which is modified variant of the likelihood. This variant omits “nuisance parameters” (parameters which are not of direct interest and subsequently not needed in the estimation method) from the computation of the likelihood. This restricted version of the likelihood is then maximized and the estimation method using this modified likelihood is called Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML).\nWhen REML is used to estimate parameters, the residual standard error turns out to be the same as that computed in the OLS estimation. As such, sometimes this estimate is referred to as the REML estimate of the residual standard error."

    "text": "Preparation\nIn this set of notes, you will use information theoretic approaches (e.g., information criteria) to select one (or more) empirically supported model from a set of candidate models. To do so, we will use the mn-schools.csv dataset:\n\nCSV File\nData Codebook\n\nOur goal will be to examine if (and how) academic “quality” of the student-body (measured by SAT score) is related to institutional graduation rate.\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(AICcmodavg)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read in data\nmn = read_csv(file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/bespectacled-antelope/main/data/mn-schools.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nWorking Hypotheses and Candidate Models\nOver the prior sets of notes, we have considered several models that explain variation in graduation rates.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathbf{Model~1:~} \\quad \\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}}_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) + \\epsilon_i \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathbf{Model~2:~} \\quad \\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}}_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) + \\beta_2(\\mathrm{Public}_i) + \\epsilon_i \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathbf{Model~3:~} \\quad \\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}}_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\mathrm{SAT}_i) + \\beta_2(\\mathrm{Public}_i) + \\beta_3(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)(\\mathrm{Public}_i) + \\epsilon_i\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nwhere all three models have \\(\\epsilon_i\\overset{i.i.d.}{\\sim}\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\\).\n\n# Fit candidate models\nlm.1 = lm(grad ~ 1 + sat, data = mn)\nlm.2 = lm(grad ~ 1 + sat + public, data = mn)\nlm.3 = lm(grad ~ 1 + sat + public + sat:public, data = mn)\n\nEach of these models correspond to a different scientific working hypothesis about how graduation rates and median SAT scores are related:\n\nH1: The effect of median SAT scores on graduation rates is constant across all levels of SAT, and educational sector does not have an effect on graduation rates.\nH2: The effect of median SAT scores on graduation rates is constant across all levels of SAT. And, while there is also an effect of educational sector on graduation rates, the effect of median SAT scores is identical for both public and private schools.\nH3: The effect of median SAT scores on graduation rates is constant across all levels of SAT. Moreover, this effect varies across educational sector.\n\n\nThese working hypotheses are typically created from the theory and previous empirical work in a substantive area. They need to be translated into a statistical models, which can be quite difficult, especially if there is not a lot of theory to guide this translation.\n\nOne method for choosing among a set of candidate models is to pick based on the residuals. In this method, we adopt the model for which the data best meet the assumptions, and employing the principle of parsimony—adopting the more parsimonious model when there are multiple models that produce equally “good” residuals. Additionally, we can use the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to help make this decision. This method provides additional empirical evidence about which model is supported when the candidate models are nested.\nUnfortunately, we cannot always use the LRT to select models, since there are many times when the set of candidate models are not all nested. Information criteria give us metrics to compare the empirical support for models whether they are nested or not. In the remainder of these notes, we will examine several of the more popular information criteria metrics used for model selection.\n\n\n\nAkiake’s Information Criteria (AIC)\nThe AIC metric is calculated by adding a penalty term to the model’s deviance (\\(-2\\ln(\\mathrm{Likelihood})\\)).\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nAIC &= \\mathrm{Deviance} + 2k \\\\[1ex]\n&= -2\\ln(\\mathcal{L}) + 2k\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nwhere k is the number of parameters (including the residual standard error) being estimated in the model. (Recall that the value for k is given as df in the logLik() output.)\nRemember that deviance is similar to error (it measures model-data misfit), and so models that have lower values of deviance are more empirically supported. The problem with deviance, however, is that more complex models tend to have smaller deviances and are, therefore, more supported than their simpler counterparts. Unfortunately, these complex models tend not to generalize as well as simpler models (this is called overfitting). The AIC metric’s penalty term penalizes the deviance more when a more complex model is fitted; it is offsetting the lower degree of model-data misfit in complex models by increasing the ‘misfit’ based on the number of parameters.\nThis penalty-adjusted measure of ‘misfit’ is called Akiake’s Information Criteria (AIC). We compute the AIC for each of the candidate models and the model with the lowest AIC is selected. This model, we say, is the candidate model with the most empirical support. Below we compute the AIC for the first candidate model.\n\n# Compute AIC for Model 1\n# logLik(lm.1)\n-2*-113.5472 + 2*3\n\n[1] 233.0944\n\n\nWe could also use the AIC() function to compute the AIC value directly.

(Note that the df column from glance() does NOT give the number of model parameters.)\n\n# Model-level output for H2\nglance(lm.2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences"

    "text": "Empirical Support is for the Working Hypotheses\nBecause the models are proxies for the scientific working hypotheses, the AIC ends up being a measure of empirical support for any particular working hypothesis. Using the AIC, we can rank order the models (and subsequently the working hypotheses) based on their level of empirical support. Ranked in order of empirical support, the three scientific working hypotheses are:\n\nH2: The effect of median SAT scores on graduation rates is constant across all levels of SAT. And, while there is also an effect of educational sector on graduation rates, the effect of median SAT scores is identical for both public and private schools.\nH3: The effect of median SAT scores on graduation rates is constant across all levels of SAT. Moreover, this effect varies across educational sector.\nH1: The effect of median SAT scores on graduation rates is constant across all levels of SAT, and educational sector does not have an effect on graduation rates.\n\nIt is important to remember that the phrase given the data and other candidate models is highly important. The ranking of models/working hypotheses is a relative ranking of the models’ level of empirical support contingent on the candidate models we included in the comparison and the data we used to compute the AIC.\nAs such, this method is not able to rank any hypotheses that you did not consider as part of the candidate set of scientific working hypotheses. Moreover, the AIC is a direct function of the likelihood which is based on the actual model fitted as a proxy for the scientific working hypothesis. If the predictors used in any of the models had been different, it would lead to different likelihood and AIC values, and potentially a different rank ordering of the hypotheses.\nThe ranking of models is also based on the data we have. Even though Model 2 may not be what we expect substantively, it is more empirically supported than the interaction model (or the simple model). Why? Well, we only have data in a certain range of median SAT scores for public and private schools. Within this range of scores, Model 2 is more empirically supported, even after accounting for the additional complexity of the interaction model. If we had a broader range of median SAT scores in these two sectors (or had differentiated between private for-profit and private not-for-proft school), that evidence might support a different model. This is very important. Model 2 is the most empirically supported candidate model GIVEN the three candidate models we compared and the data we used to compute the AIC metric.\n\nThe model selection and ranking is contingent on both the set of candidate models you are evaluating, and the data you have.\n\nBased on the AIC values for the three candidate models we ranked the hypotheses based on the amount of empirical support:\n\n\nCode\ncand_models = data.frame(\n  Model = c(\n    \"Model 2\",\n    \"Model 3\",\n    \"Model 1\"\n    ),\n  k = c(4, 5, 3),\n  AIC = c(AIC(lm.2), AIC(lm.3), AIC(lm.1))\n) \n\ncand_models |>\n  gt() |>\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(Model),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |>\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(k, AIC),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |>\n  cols_label(\n    Model = md(\"*Model*\"),\n    k = md(\"*k*\"),\n    AIC = md(\"*AIC*\")\n  ) |>\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(40)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Models rank-ordered by the amount of empirical support as measured by the AIC. \n  \n  \n    \n      Model\n      k\n      AIC\n    \n  \n  \n    Model 2\n4\n225.5929\n    Model 3\n5\n227.0044\n    Model 1\n3\n233.0944"

    "text": "Adding a Title and Subtitle (Using Quarto)\nIf you are creating a table within a QMD document, we will use the code chunk options to add a table number, title, and subtitle. To create these use the following code chunks:\n\nThe label: field is used to label the table and give it a table number. The key here is that the lable name must start withtbl-. In the example below, the label name I gave the table is tbl-summary-measures.\nThe tbl-cap: field is used to provide a table caption, similar to how fig-cap: is used to give a figure caption.\nThe tbl-subcap: field is used to provide a table subcaption. Not all tables need a subcaption!\nThe tbl-cap-location: field can be use to change the table caption location from top to bottom, or even have it placed in the margin.\n\nHere we show the R code chunk and chunk options to produce the table numbering and caption. (I do not use a subcaption on this table.) The resulting table, along with its numbering (which is autopopulated by Quarto), and caption is shown below.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-summary-measures\n#| tbl-cap: \"Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor, and five covariates.\"\ntab_01 |>\n  gt() |>\n  cols_label(\n    variable = md(\"*Variable*\"),\n    m = md(\"*M*\"),\n    sd = md(\"*SD*\"),\n    min = md(\"*Min.*\"),\n    max = md(\"*Max.*\")\n  ) |>\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(variable),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |>\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(m, sd, min, max),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |>\n  opt_align_table_header(\"left\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

In the document’s text you can link to that table using the @ and giving the table name. For example, see Table 1. To do this I wrote the following in my Quarto document:\nFor example, see @tbl-summary-measures.\nSee here for more detail about cross-referencing tables, substables, figures, equations, and more!\n\nChanging the Formatting of the Table Numbering\nWe can change how Quarto formats the table labeling in the YAML part of the document. The default is: “Table X: Table Caption”. Here we make “Table X.” bold with a period after it, where “X” is an arabic number.\ncrossref:\n  tbl-title: \"**Table**\"\n  tbl-labels: arabic\n  title-delim: \".\""

    "text": "Preparation\nIn this set of notes, you will learn another method of dealing with nonlinearity. Specifically, we will look at log-transforming the predictor in a linear model. To do so, we will use the mn-schools.csv dataset:\n\nCSV File\nData Codebook\n\nOur goal will be to re-visit if (and how) academic “quality” of the student-body (measured by SAT score) is related to institutional graduation rate. Within this work, we will use information theoretic approcaches (namely the AICc and related measures) to evaluate any fitted models.\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(AICcmodavg)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(educate)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read in data\nmn = read_csv(file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/bespectacled-antelope/main/data/mn-schools.csv\")\n\n# View data\nmn\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between Graduation Rate and SAT Scores\nIn a previous set of notes, we determined that the relationship between SAT scores and graduation rates was curvilinear. We initially saw evidence of this curvilinearity in the scatterplot of graduation rates versus median SAT scores. After fitting a model assuming a linear relationship (syntax not shown), the plot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values also suggests that the linearity assumption is not tenable.\n\n\nCode\n# Scatterplot\np1 = ggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n# Fit linear model\nlm_raw = lm(grad ~ 1 + sat, data = mn)\n\n# Obtain residuals and fitted values\nout_raw = augment(lm_raw)\n\n# Check linearity assumptions\np2 = ggplot(data = out_raw, aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Fitted values\") +\n  ylab(\"Standardized residual\")\n\n# Layout plot\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: LEFT: Six-year graduation rate as a function of median SAT score. The loess smoother (blue line) is also displayed. RIGHT: Scatterplot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values for a model using median SAT scores to predict variation in six-year graduation rates. The reference line of Y=0 is also displayed along with the 95% confidence envelope (grey shaded area). The loess smoother (solid, blue line) shows the empirical relationship betwen the residuals and fitted values.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to model this nonlinearity is to fit a model that included a quadratic polynomial effect. Remember that the quadratic function is ‘U’-shaped. In our example, the quadratic term was negative, which creates an upside-down ‘U’-shape. This negative quadratic function is shown in the left-had side of the figure below.\nWe do not have to use a quadratic function to model curvilinear relationships. We can use any mathematical function that mimics the curvilinear pattern observed in the data.1 One mathematical function that is useful for modeling curvilinearity is the logarithmic function. The logarithmic function is shown in the right-hand side of the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nfig_01 = data.frame(\n  x = seq(from = -5, to = 3, by = 0.1)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(y =  -(x^2))\n\np1 = ggplot(data = fig_01, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_light() +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"X\", breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Y\", breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Quadratic Function\")\n\n\nfig_02 = data.frame(\n  x = seq(from = 0.1, to = 5, by = 0.1)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(y =  log2(x))\n\np2 = ggplot(data = fig_02, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_light() +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"X\", breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Y\", breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Logarithmic Function\")\n\n# Layout the plots\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: LEFT: Negative quadratic function of X. RIGHT: Logarithmic function of X.\n\n\n\n\nThese two functions have some similarities. They both model non-linear growth (continuous and diminishing growth). However, in the quadratic function, this growth eventually peaks and then is followed by continuous and increasing loss (parabola; the function changes direction). The logarithmic function, on the other hand, does not change direction—it continues to grow, albeit ever diminishing in the amount of growth.2\nAs you consider different mathematical functions, it is important to consider the substantive knowledge in an area. For example, while empirically both the quadratic polynomial model and the logarithmic model might both suggest reasonable fit to the data, in this context, the logarithmic model might be a more substantively sound model than the quadratic polynomial model. We would probably expect that the effect of SAT on graduation rate would diminish for schools with higher median SAT scores, but that it wouldn’t actually change direction. (This would mean that at some value, an increase in SAT would be asociated with a lower graduation rate!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSo long as we can ultimately write this function as a linear model, namely, \\(Y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1(x_i) + \\epsilon_i\\).↩︎\nMathematically, the instantaneous derivative of the logarithmic function is is always positive, but it approaches 0 for larger values of x, while that for the quadratic function eventually becomes negative.↩︎"

    "text": "Interpret the Regression Results\nWe can now look at the regression output and interpret the results.\n\n# Model-level output\nglance(lm.log)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nExamining the model-level output, we see that differences in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) explain 81.13% of the variation in graduation rates. Since differences in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) imply that there are differences in the raw SAT scores, we would typically just say that “differences in SAT scores explain 81.13% of the variation in graduation rates.”\nMoving to the coefficient-level output,\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.log)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can write the fitted equation as,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} = -306.7 + 106.4\\bigg[\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)\\bigg]\n\\]\nWe can interpret the coefficients as we always do, recognizing that these interpretation are based on the log-transformed predictor.\n\nThe intercept value of \\(-306.7\\) is the predicted average graduation rate for all colleges/universities with a \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) value of 0.\nThe slope value of 106.4 indicates that each one-unit difference in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) is associated with a 106.4-unit difference in graduation rate, on average.\n\n\n\nBetter Interpretations: Back-transforming to the Raw Metric\nWhile these interpretations are technically correct, it is more helpful to your readers (and more conventional) to interpret any regression results in the raw metric of the variable rather than log-transformed metric. This means we have to back-transform the interpretations. To back-transform a logarithm, we use its inverse function; exponentiation.\nWe interpreted the intercept as, “the predicted average graduation rate for all colleges/universities with a \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) value of 0”. To interpret this using the raw metric of our SAT attribute, we have to understand what \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) = 0\\) is equivalent to in the original SAT variable’s scale. Mathematically,\n\\[\n\\log_2 (\\mathrm{SAT}) = 0 \\quad \\mathrm{is~equivalent~to} \\quad 2^{0} = \\mathrm{SAT} \\\\\n\\]\nIn this computation, \\(\\mathrm{SAT}=1\\). Thus, rather than using the log-transformed interpretation, we can, instead, interpret the intercept as,\n\nThe predicted average graduation rate for all colleges/universities with a median SAT value of 1 (which since this is measures in hundreds corresponds to a median SAT of 100) is \\(-306.7\\). Since there are no colleges/universities in our data that have a median SAT value of 1, this is extrapolation.\n\nWhat about the slope? Our interpretation was that “each one-unit difference in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) is associated with a 106.4-unit difference in graduation rate, on average.” Working with the same idea of back-transformation, we need to understand what a one-unit difference in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) means. Consider four values of \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) that are each one-unit apart:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 1\\\\\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 2\\\\\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 3\\\\\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 4\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nIf we back-transform each of these, then we can see how the four values of the raw SAT variable would differ.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^1 = 2\\\\\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^2 = 4\\\\\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^3 = 8\\\\\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^4 = 16\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) is increased by one-unit, the raw SAT value is doubled. We can use this in our interpretation of slope:\n\nA doubling of the SAT value is associated with a 106.4 percentage point difference in graduation rate, on average.\n\nThe technical language for doubling is a “two-fold difference”. So we would conventionally interpret this as:\n\nEach two-fold difference in SAT value is associated with a 106.4 percentage point difference in graduation rate, on average.\n\nTo understand this further, consider a specific school, say Augsburg. Their measurement on the raw SAT variable is 10.3, and their log-transformed SAT score is 3.36. Using the fitted regression equation (which employs the log-transformed SAT),\n\n-306.7 + 106.4 * 3.36\n\n[1] 50.804\n\n\nAugsburg’s predicted graduation rate would be 50.8. If we increase the l2sat score by 1 to 4.36 (which is equivalent to a raw SAT measurement of 20.6; double 10.3), their predicted graduation rate would be,\n\n-306.7 + 106.4 * 4.36\n\n[1] 157.204\n\n\nThis is an increase of 106.4 percentage points from the predicted value of 50.8 when the l2sat value was 3.36.\n\n\n\nAlternative Method of Fitting the Model\nRather that create the log-transformed SAT score as a new column in the data and then using this column in the model, we can use the log() function directly on the SAT predictor in the lm() computation.3\n\nlm.log = lm(grad ~ 1 + log(sat, base = 2), data = mn)\n\n# Model-level output\nglance(lm.log)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.log)"

Recall that our fitted equation was:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} = -306.7 + 106.4\\bigg[\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)\\bigg]\n\\]\nWe can implement this into the geom_function() layer of our ggplot() syntax.\n\n# Plot\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n    geom_function(\n      fun = function(x) {-306.7 + 106.4*log(x, base = 2)}\n      ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nPlot of the predicted graduation rate as a function of median SAT score. The non-linearity in the plot indicates that there is a diminishing positive effect of SAT on graduation rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Form of the Fitted Equation\nThe fitted equation expresses graduation rates as a function of base-2 log-transformed median SAT scores. Alternatively, we can re-write this equation to express graduation rates as a function of raw median SAT scores. Namely,\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_i = \\log_2\\bigg(2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times X_i^{\\hat\\beta_1}\\bigg)\n\\]\nNotice that the right-hand side of this expression is a log function; it has the general form of \\(Y=\\log(\\)🦒\\()\\).4 Remember that this is the continuous decay function we were interested in using to model the curvilinearity shown in the data. The important thing is that this non-linear decay function is mathematically the same as using a the log-transformed predictor to model the outcome with linear model.\n\\[\n\\log_2\\bigg(2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times X_i^{\\hat\\beta_1}\\bigg) \\equiv \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\bigg[\\log_2(X_i)\\bigg]\n\\]\nPractically speaking, this means we can model non-linearity using a linear model. Which means we can use the lm() function and all the other ideas you have learned about linear models (e.g., including covariates, adding interaction effects, assumption checking).\n\nTo understand how we re-express in this alternative form, consider the general mathematical expression of the fitted equation:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_i = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\bigg[\\log_2(X_i)\\bigg]\n\\]\nNow we will work through the algebra to relate \\(\\hat{Y}_i\\) to \\(X_i\\). Because there is a log of X we need to exponentiate both sides of the equation to get back to the raw X.\n\\[\n2^{\\hat{Y}_i} = 2^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\bigg[\\log_2(X_i)\\bigg]}\n\\]\nThen we can use the algebraic rules of exponents and logarithms to re-express this equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n2^{\\hat{Y}_i} &= 2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times 2^{\\hat\\beta_1\\bigg[\\log_2(X_i)\\bigg]} \\\\[1ex]\n2^{\\hat{Y}_i} &= 2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times \\bigg[2^{\\log_2(X_i)}\\bigg]^{\\hat\\beta_1} \\\\[1ex]\n2^{\\hat{Y}_i} &= 2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times X_i^{\\hat\\beta_1}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNow the only problem is that the left-hand side is \\(2^{\\hat{Y}_i}\\) and not \\(Y_i\\). To fix this we take the logarithm (base-2) of both sides of the equation.\n\\[\n\\log_2\\bigg(2^{\\hat{Y}_i}\\bigg) = \\log_2\\bigg(2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times X_i^{\\hat\\beta_1}\\bigg)\n\\]\nThis gives us an expression of the curve that relates the outcome to the predictor.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Alternative Form of the Fitted Equation with the Example\nIn our example, the fitted equation can be re-expressed as:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} = \\log_2\\bigg(2^{-306.7} \\times \\mathrm{SAT}_i^{106.4}\\bigg)\n\\]\nWe can also use this alternative expression in the geom_function() layer of our ggplot() syntax.\n\n# Plot\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n    geom_function(\n      fun = function(x) {log(2^-306.7 * x^106.4 , base = 2)}\n      ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Plot of the predicted graduation rate as a function of median SAT score.

This implies that Augsburg’s residual would also be the same in the two models. This is true for every college. Because of this, increasing (or decreasing) the base used in the logarithm does not help improve the fit of the model. The fit is exactly the same no matter which base you choose.\n\nThe only thing that changes when you choose a different base is the interpretation of the slope. You should choose the base to facilitate interpretation. For example, does it make more sense to talk about a two-fold difference in the predictor? A five-fold difference in the predictor? A ten-fold difference in the predictor?"

    "text": "Preparation\nIn this set of notes, you will learn a method for dealing with a different pattern of nonlinearity. Specifically, we will look at log-transforming the predictor in a linear model. This transformation can also help rectify violations of the homogeneity of variance assumption. To do so, we will use the carbon.csv dataset:\n\nCSV File\nData Codebook\n\nOur analytic goal will be to explain variation in worldwide carbon emissions. Within this work, we will use information theoretic approcaches (namely the AICc and related measures) to evaluate any fitted models.\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(AICcmodavg)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(educate) \nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(texreg)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read in data\ncarbon = read_csv(file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/bespectacled-antelope/main/data/carbon.csv\")\n\n# View data\ncarbon\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between Wealth and Carbon Emissions\nTo being the analysis, we will examine the marginal distributions of wealth (predictor) and carbon emissions (outcome), as well as a scatterplot between them for our sample data.\n\n# Marginal distribution of co2 (outcome)\np1 = ggplot(data = carbon, aes(x = co2)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Carbon emissions (metric tons per person)\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\")\n\n# Marginal distribution of wealth (predictor)\np2 = ggplot(data = carbon, aes(x = wealth)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Wealth\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\")\n\n# Scatterplot\np3 = ggplot(data = carbon, aes(x = wealth, y = co2)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Wealth\") +\n  ylab(\"Carbon emissions (metric tons per person)\") +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 6.4, y = 38, label = \"Quatar\", size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 4.6, y = 31.3, label = \"Trinidad and Tobago\", size = 3, hjust = 1) \n\n# Place figures side-by-side\n(p1 / p2) |  p3\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Density plot of the distribution of carbon dioxide emissions (LEFT) and wealth (CENTER). The scatterplot (RIGHT) shows the relationship between wealth and carbon dioxide emissions. The loess smoother (blue line) is also displayed on the scatterplot. Two countries having extreme CO2 emissions are also identified.\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of CO2 emissions is severely right-skewed. Although the median emissions is around 2.5 metric tons per person, the plot shows evidence that several countries have high emissions. The distribution of wealth is more symmetric (perhaps a little left-skewed), with most countries having a weath level around 3.5.\nThe scatterplot suggests a positive, nonlinear relationship between wealth and CO2 emissions; countries that are wealthier also tend to have higher CO2 emissions. It also suggests that there is more variation in CO2 emissions at higher levels of wealth than at lower levels of wealth—potential violation of the homoskedasticity assumption.\nWe can see these assumption violations much more clearly in the scatterplot of residuals versus fitted values from a fitted linear model regressing CO2 emissions on wealth.\n\n# Fit model\nlm.1 = lm(co2 ~ 1 + wealth, data = carbon)\n\n# Obtain residual plots\nresidual_plots(lm.1)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Density plot of the standardized residuals (LEFT) and scatterplot of the standarized residuals versus the fitted values (RIGHT) from regressing CO2 emissions on wealth in a linear model. The reference line of Y=0 is also displayed along with the 95% confidence envelope (grey shaded area). The loess smoother (solid, blue line) shows the empirical relationship betwen the residuals and fitted values.\n\n\n\n\nThese plots suggest violations of the normality assumption (the marginal distribution of the residuals is right-skewed) and of the assumption of homoskedasticity. The assumption that the average residual is 0, also may be in question, as the confidence envelope for the loess smoother deviates from the \\(Y=0\\) line for fitted values between 50 and 70."

While we could create the log-transformed CO2 emissions as a new column in the data, and use that new column in our plots and models, we will instead use the log() function directly on the outcome in our ggplot() and lm() functions.\n\n# Scatterplot\nggplot(data = carbon, aes(x = wealth, y = log(co2))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Wealth\") +\n  ylab(\"ln(Carbon emissions)\") +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 6.4, y = 3.64, label = \"Quatar\", size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 4.6, y = 3.44, label = \"Trinidad and Tobago\", size = 3, hjust = 1) \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot between wealth and log-transformed CO2 emissions.

The relationship between wealth and the log-transformed CO2 emissions is much more linear. The two movies which had extremely high CO2 emissions when we examined raw CO2, no longer seems like outliers in the transformed data. The differences in variation of log-carbon emissions between lower wealtyh and higher wealth countries also seems less severe.\nHas this helped us better meet the distributional assumptions for the regression model? To find out, we will re-fit the model using the log-transformed budget and examine the residual plots.\n\n# Fit model\nlm.2 = lm(log(co2) ~ 1 + wealth, data = carbon)\n\n# Obtain residual plots\nresidual_plots(lm.2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Density plot of the standardized residuals (LEFT) and scatterplot of the standarized residuals versus the fitted values (RIGHT) from regressing log-transformed CO2 emisssions on wealth.

The assumption of homoskedasticity also looks markedly improved. There still seems to be violations of the linearity assumption, and in fact we see in the original scatterplot between wealth and the log-transformed CO2 emissions the same pattern of non-linearity we saw in the MN colleges data.\n\nFor now, we will proceed so you understand how to interpret coefficients from models where the outcome has been log-transformed, but we will come back and fix this nonlinearity later."

(Remember, explaining variation in log-emissions is the same as explaining variation in emissions.)\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFrom the coefficient-level output, the fitted equation is:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i}\\right) = -2.20 + 0.824(\\mathrm{Wealth}_i)\n\\]\nWith log-transformations, there are two possible interpretations we can offer. The first is to interpret the coefficients using the log-transformed metric. These we interpret in the exact same way we do any other regression coefficients (except we use log-outcome instead of outcome):\n\nThe intercept, \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = -2.20\\), is the average predicted log-emission for countries with a wealth level of 0 (extrapolation).\nThe slope, \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = 0.824\\), indicates that each one-point difference in the wealth measure is associated with log-emssion that differs by \\(0.824\\), on average.\n\n\n\nBack-Transforming: A More Useful Interpretation\nA second, probably more useful, interpretation is to back-transform the metric of log-emisssions to the metric of raw emissions. To think about how to do this, we first consider a more general expression of the fitted linear model:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\hat{Y}_i\\right) = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(X_{i})\n\\]\nThe left-hand side of the equation is in the log-transformed metric, which drives our interpretations. If we want to instead, interpret using the raw metric of Y, we need to back-transform from \\(\\ln(Y)\\) to Y. To back-transform, we use the inverse function, which is to exponentiate using the base of the logarithm, in our case, base-e.\n\\[\ne^{\\ln(Y_i)} = Y_i\n\\]\nIf we exponentiate the left-hand side of the equation, to maintain the equality, we also need to exponentiate the right-hand side of the equation.\n\\[\ne^{\\ln(Y_i)} = e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(X_{i})}\n\\]\nThen we use rules of exponents to simplify this.\n\\[\nY_i = e^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times e^{\\hat\\beta_1(X_{i})}\n\\]\nFor our example, we exponentiate both sides of the fitted equation to get the following back-transformed fitted equation:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} = e^{-2.20} \\times e^{0.824(\\mathrm{Wealth}_i)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSubstituting in Values for Wealth to Interpret Effects\nTo interpret the back-transformed effects, we can substitute in the different values for wealth and solve. For example when wealth = 0:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} &= e^{-2.20} \\times e^{0.824(0)}\\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 1 \\\\\n&= 0.111\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe predicted CO2 emissions for a countries that have a wealth level of 0 is 0.111 metric tons per person, on average (extrapolation). How about countries that have a wealth level of 1 (a one-point difference in wealth from countries that have a wealth level of 0)?\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} &= e^{-2.20} \\times e^{0.824(1)}\\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 2.28 \\\\\n&= 0.253\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe predicted CO2 emission for a countries that have a wealth level of 1 is 0.253 metric tons per person. This is 2.28 TIMES the emissions of countries that have a wealth level of 0. Rather than using the language of TIMES difference you could also use the language of fold difference. In this case the slope coefficient would be interpreted as,\n\nInterpretation\nEach one-unit difference in wealth level is associated with a 2.28-fold difference in carbon emissions, on average.\n\nSimply put, when we back-transform from interpretations of log-Y to Y the interpretations are multiplicatively related to the intercept rather than additively related. We can obtain these multiplicative values (and the back-transformed intercept) by using the exp() function to exponentiate the coefficients from the fitted model, which we can obtain using the coef() function.\n\n# Obtain back-transformed interpretations\nexp(coef(lm.2))\n\n(Intercept)      wealth \n  0.1111884   2.2788237"

As you use re-expressions further down-the-ladder, the variation in the re-expressed data decreases (Less variation = less information). Eventually, the variation in the re-expressed data will be so small that the values become indistinguishable (no information).\nIn the other direction, as you use re-expressions further up-the-ladder, the variation in the re-expressed data increases (more variation = more information), albeit spuriously.

For the intercept, when log(brain weight) is 0, actual brain weight = 1. Thus, mammals with a 1-gram brain weight have a predicted log(body weight) of \\(-2.51\\), on average.

As such, we choose a series of brain weights that differ by 1% and plug them into our fitted equation to get predicted log(body weights):\n\n# Choose brain weights that differ by 1%\nbody = c(100, 101, 102.01)\n\n# Get predicted ln(body weight) values\n-2.51 + 1.22 * log(body)\n\n[1] 3.108308 3.120447 3.132586\n\n\nThe interpretation is:\n\nEach 1% difference in brain weight is associated with a difference of 0.012 in log(body weight), on average.\n\nHere 0.012 is the slope coefficient divided by 100. Now let’s transform the log(body weight) values to raw body weights.

There are several mathematical functions that do this. One commonly used function that meets these specifications is the logistic function. Mathematically, the logistic function is:\n\\[\n\\Lambda(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n\\]\nwhere x is the value fed into the logistic function. For example, to logistically transform \\(x=3\\), we use\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\Lambda(3) &= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-3}} \\\\[1ex]\n&= 0.953\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nBelow we show how to transform many such values using R.\n\n# Create w values and transformed values\nexample = tibble(\n  x = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01)  # Set up values\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    Lambda = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))  # Transform using logistic function\n  )\n\n# View data\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the logistically transformed values for a sequence of values from -4 to 4.\n\n\n# Plot the results\nggplot(data = example, aes(x = x, y = Lambda)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the logistically transformed values for a sequence of values from -4 to 4.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that by using this transformation we get a monotonic “S”-shaped curve. Now try substituting a really large value of x into the function. This gives an asymptote at 1. Also substitute a really “large”” negative value in for x. This gives an asymptote at 0. So this function also bounds the output between 0 and 1."

    "text": "Odds: A Ratio of Probabilities\nThe ratio that we are taking the logarithm of, \\(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1 - \\pi_i}\\), is referred to as odds. Odds are the ratio of two probabilities. Namely the chance an event occurs (\\(\\pi_i\\)) versus the chance that same event does not occur (\\(1 - \\pi_i\\)). As such, it gives the relative probability of that event occurring. To understand this better, we will look at a couple examples.\nLet’s assume that the probability of getting an “A” in a course is 0.7. Then we know the probability of NOT getting an “A” in that course is 0.3. The odds of getting an “A” are then\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Odds} = \\frac{0.7}{0.3} = 2.33\n\\]\nThe relative probability of getting an “A” is 2.33. That is, the probability of getting an “A” in the class is 2.33 times more likely than NOT getting an “A” in the class.\nAs another example, Fivethirtyeight.com predicted on March 08, 2022 that the probability the Minnesota Wild would win the Stanley Cup was 0.02. The odds of the Minnesota Wild winning the Stanley Cup is then:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Odds} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = 0.0204\n\\]\nThe probability that the Minnesota Wild win the Stanley Cup is 0.0204 times as likely them NOT winning the Stanley Cup. (Odds less than 1 indicate that is is more likely for an event NOT to occur than to occur. Invert the fraction to compute how much more like the event is not to occur.)\n\nIn the logistic model, we are predicting the log-odds (also referred to as the logit. When we get these values, we typically transform the logits to odds by inverting the log-transformation (take e to that power.)\n\n\n\nRelationship between X and Different Transformations\nLet’s re-examine the plot of the “S”-shaped example data, which showed the relationship between a predictor X and outcome Y, where Y was on the probability scale; akin to our ACT scores versus the probability of obtaining a degree. How does transforming Y to odds or log-odds change the relationship?\n\n# Create odds and logit values\nexample = example |>\n  mutate(\n    Odds = Lambda / (1 - Lambda),  # Transform to odds\n    Logits = log(Odds)\n  )\n\n# View data\nexample\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# S-shaped curve (probabilities)\np1 = ggplot(data = example, aes(x = x, y = Lambda)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_light() +\n  ylab(\"Probabilities\")\n\n# Exponential growth curve (odds)\np2 = ggplot(data = example, aes(x = x, y = Odds)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_light() +\n  ylab(\"Odds\")\n\n# Linear (log-odds)\np3 = ggplot(data = example, aes(x = x, y = Logits)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_light() +\n  ylab(\"Logits\")\n\n# Output plots\np1 | p2 | p3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot showing the relationship between the probability of Y versus X (LEFT), the odds of Y versus X (CENTER), and the log-odds of Y versus X (RIGHT).\n\n\n\n\nNote that by transforming the probabilities into odds, we have changed the “S”-shaped curve into a classic exponential growth curve. (The Rule-of-the-Bulge suggests we can “fix” this by applying a downward power transformation on Y.) Then, by log-transforming the Y-values (the odds in this case), the resulting relatinship is now linear. Thus an “S”-shaped curve can be “linearized” by transforming probabilities to logits (log-odds). Mathematically, this is equivalent to applying a logistic transformation to the predicted values."

That is, for these students, the probability of obtaining a degree is 0.2 times that of not obtaining a degree (Although it is extrapolating, it is far more likely these students will not obtain their degree!)\nTo interpret the effect of ACT on the odds of obtaining a degree, we will compare the odds of obtaining a degree for students that have ACT score that differ by one point. Say ACT = 0 and ACT = 1.\nWe already know the predicted odds for students with ACT = 0, namely \\(e^{-1.61}\\). For students with an ACT of 1, their predicted odds of obtaining a degree are:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{\\hat\\pi_i}{1 - \\hat\\pi_i} &= e^{-1.61} \\times e^{0.11(1)} \\\\\n&= e^{-1.61} \\times e^{0.11} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThese students odds of obtaining a degree are \\(e^{0.11}\\) times greater than students with an ACT score of 0.

For example, the intercept from the logistic fitted equation, \\(-1.61\\) was the predicted log-odds of obtaining a degree for students with an ACT of 0. To obtain the predicted probability of obtaining a degree for students with an ACT of 0:\n\nexp(-1.61) / (1 + exp(-1.61))\n\n[1] 0.1665886\n\n\nFor students with ACT of 0, the predicted probability of obtaining a degree is 0.17.\nThis transformation from log-odds to probability, is non-linear, which means that there is not a clean interpretation of the effects of ACT (i.e., the slope) on the probability of obtaining a degree To understand this effect we can plot the probability of obtaining a degree across the range of ACT scores. To do this, we use geom_function() and input the transformation to probability with the fitted equation:\n\\[\n\\hat\\pi_i = \\frac{e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)}}{1 + e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)}}\n\\]\n\n# Plot the fitted equation\nggplot(data = grad, aes(x = act, y = got_degree)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0) +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = function(x) {exp(-1.611 + 0.108*x) / (1 + exp(-1.611 + 0.108*x))}\n    ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"ACT score\") +\n  ylab(\"Predicted probability of obtaining a degree\") +\n  ylim(0, 1)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Predicted probability of obtaining a degree as a function of ACT score.\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of ACT on the probability of obtaining a degree follows a monotonic increasing “S”-curve. While there is always an increasing effect of ACT on the probability of obtaining a degree, the magnitude of this effect depends on ACT score. For lower ACT scores there is a larger effect of ACT score on the probability of obtaining a degree than for higher ACT scores.\nOne interesting point on the plot is the ACT score where the probability of obtaining a degree is 0.5. In our example, this is at an ACT score of approximately 15. This implies that students who score less than 15 are more likely to not obtain a degree than to obtain a degree (on average), and those that score higher than 15 are more likely to obtain a degree than not (on average).\n\n\nRough Interpretation of the Slope\nOne rough interpretation that is often used is to divide the slope coefficient by 4 to get an upper bound of the predictive difference in probability of Y per unit increase in X. In our example, each one-point difference in ACT score is associated with, at most, a \\(0.108/4=.027\\) difference in the probability of obtaining a degree, on average.\n\nThe mathematics behind this rough interpretation is based on maximizing the rate-of-change, which is based on setting the first derivative of the logistic function to zero and solving. Recall that the logistic function relates the probabilities to the fitted equation as:\n\\[\n\\hat\\pi_i = \\frac{e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)}}{1 + e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)}}\n\\]\nThe first derivative, with respect to x is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat\\beta_1e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)}}{\\bigg[e^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)} + 1\\bigg]^2}\n\\]\nThis is maximized when \\(\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i)=0\\), which means we can substitute 0 into the derivative to determine the maximum rate-of-change:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n&= \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1e^{0}}{\\bigg[e^{0} + 1\\bigg]^2} \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1}{\\bigg[1 + 1\\bigg]^2} \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1}{4} \\\\[1ex]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThus the maximum rate-of-change is the based on the slope coefficient divided by four."

This value quantified the amount of variation in the outcome that was explainable by the predictors included in the model.

This measured the proportion of reduction in the residuals from the baseline to the fitted model.\nWith logistic models, there is no sum of squared error, so we cannot compute an \\(R^2\\) value. However, the residual deviance is a similar measure to the sum of squared error. We can substitute the deviance in for SSE in our computation,\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Pseudo}\\mbox{-}R^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Deviance}_{\\mathrm{Baseline}} - \\mathrm{Deviance}_{\\mathrm{Model}}}{\\mathrm{Deviance}_{\\mathrm{Baseline}}}\n\\]\nThis measure is referred to as a pseudo-\\(R^2\\) value.

A naive interpretation is that differences in ACT scores explains 3.28% of the variation in graduation status. However, this interpretation is a bit sketchy. Pseudo \\(R^2\\) values mimic \\(R^2\\) values in that they are generally on a similar scale, ranging from 0 to 1 (though remember pseudo \\(R^2\\) values can be negative). Moreover, higher pseudo \\(R^2\\) values, like \\(R^2\\) values, indicate better model fit. So while I wouldn’t offer the earlier interpretation of the value of 0.0328 in a paper, the value close to 0 does suggest that ACT scores are not perhaps incredibly predictive of the log-odds (or odds or probability) of obtaining a degree.\n\nIn logistic regression, several other pseudo \\(R^2\\) values have also been proposed.

The counts in those four cells are referred to as cell counts or cell sample sizes. These are generally notated symbolically as \\(n_{i,j}\\) where i indicates the row and j indicates the column. For example, \\(n_{1,2}=440\\) indicates the number of non-first generation students who obtained a degree.\nMarginal Counts: The counts in the “Total” row and column are called the marginal counts, or marginal sample sizes. They indicate the total counts collapsing across either rows or columns. These are generally notated symbolically as \\(n_{\\bullet,j}\\) or \\(n_{i, \\bullet}\\) where the dot indicates that we are collapsing across either rows or columns. For example, \\(n_{2,\\bullet}=1637\\) indicates the number of first generation students.\nGrand Count: Finally, there is the cell that includes the grand total sample size. This is usually just denoted as N (or sometimes \\(n_{\\bullet,\\bullet}\\)). In our example, \\(n=2344\\), the total number of students in the sample.\n\nThe three different totals (row total, column total, grand total) means that we can compute three different proportions for each of the four cells. Each proportion has a different interpretation depending on which total is used in the denominator. For example, consider the cell that designates first generation students who obtained a degree (\\(n_{2,2}=1227\\)).\n\nThe grand total of 2344 indicates all student, so computing the proportion using that denominator, \\(1227/2344 = 0.523\\), indicates that 0.523 of all students are first generation who obtained a degree.\nThe row total of 1637 indicates the number of students who are first generation students, so computing the proportion using that denominator, \\(1227/1637 = 0.750\\), indicates that 0.750 of all first generation students obtained a degree.\nThe column total of 1717 indicates the number of students who obtained a degree, so computing the proportion using that denominator, \\(1227/1717 = 0.715\\), indicates that 0.715 of students who obtained a degree are first generation students."

We will again use data from the file graduation.csv to explore predictors of college graduation.\n\nCSV File\nData Codebook\n\nWithin the analysis, we will focus on the research question of whether the probability of obtaining a degree differs for first and non-first generation students. We will use information criteria as the framework of evidence to adopt different models, along with an evaluation of the models’ residuals.\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(AICcmodavg)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(texreg)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read in data and create dummy variable for categorical variables\ngrad = read_csv(file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/bespectacled-antelope/main/data/graduation.csv\") |>\n  mutate(\n    got_degree = if_else(degree == \"Yes\", 1, 0),\n    is_firstgen = if_else(first_gen == \"Yes\", 1, 0),\n    is_nontrad = if_else(non_traditional == \"Yes\", 1, 0),\n  )\n\n# View data\ngrad\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Fit models from previous notes\nglm.0 = glm(got_degree ~ 1, data = grad, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\nglm.1 = glm(got_degree ~ 1 + act, data = grad, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\nglm.2 = glm(got_degree ~ 1 + is_firstgen, data = grad, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nThe results from glm.2 indicated that there were differences between first and non-first generation students in the probability of obtaining a degree. Based on this model’s result, we found that the predicted probability of obtaining a degre for first generation students was 0.780 while that for non-first generation students was 0.622. Does this difference persist after controlling for other covariates?\nTo examine this, we want to fit a set of models that systematically include potential covariates along with first generation status. Our strategy for this is to start with the most important covariate. We can compare the model that includes first generation status and this covariate to a model that just includes first generation status. If the evidence indicates that the model with only first generation status is important we are done. If the evidence points toward the model that also includes the most important covariate, then we will continue by comparing that model to one that includes first generation status and the two most important covariates. We will continue with these comparisons until we adopt a final model or models.\nTo determine the order of importance, we can compute the correlations between each covariate and the dummy-coded outcome.\n\ngrad |>\n  select(got_degree, act, scholarship, ap_courses,is_nontrad) |>\n  correlate()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe rank ordering of covariates (based on the absolute value of the correlation coefficients) will be:\n\nACT scores (\\(r = 0.195\\), most important)\nNumber of AP courses (\\(r = 0.149\\))\nScholarship amount (\\(r = 0.142\\))\nNon-traditional status (\\(r = -0.084\\))\n\n\n\n\nIncluding the Effect of ACT\nTo begin the analysis, we will include ACT scores as a covariate in the model. Since the act variable is continuous, we need to use the “correct” functional form when we include it in the model. In the previous set of notes, we saw some misfit when we examined the binned residual plot for the logistic regression model that included ACT as a predictor of the probability of obtaining a degree. One possibility is that this may be because the effect of ACT on these probabilities is non-linear. To examine this, we can plot the empirical log-odds of obtaining a degree versus ACT scores, and examine the functional form of the relationship.\n\n\nCode\n# Obtain the log-odds who obtain a degree for each ACT score\nprop_grad = grad |> \n  group_by(act, degree) |> \n  summarize(N = n()) |> \n  mutate(\n    Prop = N / sum (N)\n    ) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(degree == \"Yes\") |>\n  mutate(\n    Odds = Prop / (1 - Prop),\n    Logits = log(Odds)\n  )\n\n# Scatterplot\nggplot(data = prop_grad, aes(x = act, y = Logits)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = N)) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(weight = N), method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"ACT score\") +\n  ylab(\"Log-odds of obtaining a degree\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Log-odds of obtaining a degree conditional on ACT score. Size of the dot is proportional to sample size. The loess smoother is also weighted based on the sample size.\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests a non-linear relationship between ACT score and the log-odds of obtaining a degree. Using the Rule-of-the-Bulge, we can try to linearize this relationship by:\n\nIncluding a quadratic effect of ACT; or\nLog-transforming the ACT variable.\n\n\n# Fit non-linear models\nglm.1_quad = glm(got_degree ~ 1 + act + I(act^2), data = grad, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\nglm.1_log = glm(got_degree ~ 1 + log(act), data = grad, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\n# Obtain binned residuals\nout.1_quad = binned_residuals(glm.1_quad)\nout.1_log = binned_residuals(glm.1_log)\n\n# Binned residual plots\nplot(out.1_quad) | plot(out.1_log)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Binned residual plots for two models that include non-linear effects of ACT. The quadratic model (LEFT) and the log-linear model (RIGHT).\n\n\n\n\nThe binned resdiuals show slightly better fit to the log-linear model than to the quadratic model. We also examine the empirical evidence via information criteria."

This is because of the quadratic effect of ACT. The overall trend is one of exponential growth, although the rate-of-change is not constant within this curve. The most rapid change in the odds of obtaining a degree occurs at ACT scores between 20 and 30.\nFinally, we could also transform the equation into the probability metric.

The left-hand side of the “S” is compressed, probably due to the range of ACT scores. ACT has the largest effect on the probability of obtaining a degree for scores less than 25, and then the effect begins to plateau (although it is still growing as the logistic curve is monotonic)."

However, the assumption of independence (which we don’t evaluate from the common residual plots) is probably not tenable. Recall that the data includes multiple reading achievment scores for the same student. These scores (and thus the residuals) are probably correlated—this is a violation of independence which assumes that the correlation between each set of residuals is 0.\nBecause we have a variable that identifies each student, we can actually examine this by plotting the residuals separately for each student. To do so we need to include the student_id variable as a new column in the augmented data (using mutate()) so we can show the residuals versus the fitted values by student.\n\n# Augment the model and mutate on student ID\nout = augment(lm.1) |>\n  mutate(student_id = mpls$student_id)\n\n### Show residuals by student\nggplot(data = out, aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n    theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Fitted values\") +\n  ylab(\"Studentized residuals\") +\n    facet_wrap(~student_id)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplots of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values for 22 students.\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals for several of the students show a systematic trends of being primarily positive or negative within students. For example, the residuals for several students (e.g., Sudents 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) are primarily negative. Knowing that a residual is negative gives us information that other residuals for that student are also negative. There are similar trends for students that have positive residuals. This is a sign of non-independence of the residuals. If we hadn’t had the student ID variable we could have still made a logical argument about this non-independence via substantive knowledge. For example, students who perform above average in Grade 5 will likely tend to perform well in subsequent grades (i.e., have positive residuals) relative to the population. Similarly, students who perform below average in 5th grade will tend to perform below average, relative to the population, in other grades. That is, a student’s reading achievement scores across grade levels tend to be correlated.\nTo account for this within-student correlation we need to use a statistical model that accounts for the correlation among the residuals within student. This is what mixed-effects models bring to the table. By correctly modeling the non-independence, we get more accurate standard errors and p-values.\nAnother benefit of using mixed-effects models is that we also get estimates of the variation accounted for at both the between- and within-student levels. This disaggregation of the variation allows us to determine which level is explaining more variation and to study predictors appropriate to explaining that variation. For example, suppose that you disaggregated the variation in reading achievement scores and found that:\n\n82% of the variation in these scores was at the within-student level, and\n18% of the variation in these scores was at the between-student level.\n\nWe could conclude that most of the variation in reading achievement scores is within-student, which means that we would be better off thinking about within-student predictors. (These are predictors that may vary across grade-levels for a given student.) The only within-student predictor in our example data is grade-level. Both special education status, and attendance are between-student predictors—they vary for different students, but have the same value for any one student. By including between-student predictors in the model, you would only be “chipping away” at that 18% of the variation that is between-student variation. This type of decompostion of the unexplained variation helps focus your attention and resources on the levels of variation that matter!\n\nWithin- and between-student predictors go by many other names. Other names for these predictors are time-varying predictors (within-student) and non-time-varying (between-students) predictors. Also level-1 (within-student) and level-2 (between-student) predictors."

    "section": "Partitioning Unexplained Variation",
    "text": "Partitioning Unexplained Variation\nThis model is not very informative for applied researchers in terms of characterizing change over time, but it is essential to decompose the variation into within- and between-subjects variation. In our model, there are two sources of variation. The first source of variation measures the between-student variation (how different are students’ individual “growth” curves). The second source of variation measures the within-student variation (how different are an individual’s outcome values from their individual “growth” curve).\nTo see this graphically, we show Student 1’s data along with the global “growth” curve and Student 1’s specific “growth” curves. The between-student variation is akin to the average of the squared deviations between each student-specific “growth” curve and the global “growth” curve. The left-hand plot below shows these residuals for Student 1, referred to as Level-2 residuals. The within-student variation is akin to the average of the squared deviations between each student’s outcome (vocabulary scores) and that student’s specific “growth” curve. The right-hand plot below shows these residuals for Student 1, referred to as Level-1 residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Student 1’s vocabulary scores at each time point along with the predicted change in vocabulary score over time based on the unconditional random intercepts model for all students (solid, black line) and Student 1 (blue, dashed line). The between-student variation (LEFT) and within-student variation (RIGHT) based on the residuals for Student 1 are also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nWe quantify the amount of between- and within-student variation using an estimate of variance. The between-student variance estimate is denoted \\(\\sigma^2_{b_0}\\) (or simply \\(\\sigma^20\\)), and the within-student variance estimate is denoted \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\). We can access these paramater estimates using the argument effects=\"ran_pars\" in the tidy() function.\n\n# Obtain variance estimates\ntidy(lmer.0, effects = \"ran_pars\")\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote that the output is in the standard deviation metric. We need to square these values to get the actual variance estimates.\nBetween-Student Variance:\n\\[\n\\hat\\sigma^2_0 = 1.72^2 = 2.96\n\\]\nWithin-Student Variance:\n\\[\n\\hat\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon} = 1.35^2 = 1.82\n\\]\nThese values represent the unexplained variation at each level. The total unexplained variation is the sum of these two terms.\n\n# Total unexplained variation\n2.96 + 1.82\n\n[1] 4.78\n\n\nWe can compute the proportion of unexplained variation at each level by dividing the appropriate variance estimate by this total.\n\n# Proportion of unexplained variation that is between-subjects\n2.96 / (2.96 + 1.82)\n\n[1] 0.6192469\n\n# Proportion of unexplained variation that is within-subjects\n1.82 / (2.96 + 1.82)\n\n[1] 0.3807531\n\n\nInterpreting these values:\n\nRoughly 62% of the unexplained variation in vocabulary scores is between-student variation.\nRoughly 38% of the unexplained variation in vocabulary scores is within-student variation.\n\nBased on this partitioning from the unconditional random intercepts model we have evidence that it may be fortuitous to include both between-student and within-student predictors; there is unaccounted for variation at both levels. To explain the unaccounted for between-student variation, include between-student-level predictors (e.g., female) in the model. To explain the unaccounted for within-student variation, include within-student predictors (e.g., grade) in the model.\nSince the larger proportion of unexplained variation is between-student variation, we might ultimately focus on between-student predictors more than within-student predictors. However, because this is a longitudinal analysis, our primary focus is on the grade predictor, which is a within-subjects predictor. It is here that we turn next.\n\nThis partitioning of variation should be done in every analysis, and ALWAYS is done using the unconditional random intercepts model. The unconditional random intercepts model will serve as our baseline model. As we add predictors, we can compare the unexplained variation at each level in the predictor models to the baseline unaccounted for variation in the unconditional means model. This is one way of measuring how effective predictors are at further explaining variation in the model."

It requires a condition called sphericity that makes some stringent assumptions about the variances and correlations between repeated measures. One requirement of sphericity is that the correlation between any two time points are exactly the same. Consider the correlations of our data:\n\n# Compute correlations between repeated measures\nvocabulary |>\n  select(vocab_08:vocab_11) |>\n  correlate()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe correlations are not equal, and are likely not to be equal in the population! In repeated measures data, observations that are more closely spaced in time tend to be more correlated. This violates the sphericity assumption needed for RM-ANOVA. It is rare that sphericity is ever tenablein practice with longitudinal data. Because of this it is preferable to use LMER to carry out these analyses."

    "section": "Quantitative Time Predictor: A More Flexible Model for Repeated Measures Data",
    "text": "Quantitative Time Predictor: A More Flexible Model for Repeated Measures Data\nOne advantage to using the linear mixed-effects model to analyze repeated measures data over traditional methods (e.g., RM-ANOVA or MANOVA) is that the regression model allows for both categorical and quantitative variables. For example, rather than code our grade-levels categorically (as vocab_08, vocab_09, vocab_10 and vocab_11), which was a necessity in days of yore, we could have simply coded them as 8, 9, 10, and 11. Then we could have fitted the LMER model using this quantitative predictor. The statistical model when time is quantitative would be:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Vocabulary~Score}_{ij} = \\big[\\beta_0 + b_{0j}\\big] + \\beta_1(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}) + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere,\n\n\\(\\mathrm{Vocabulary~Score}_{ij}\\) is the vocabulary score at time point \\(i\\) for student \\(j\\);\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the fixed-effect of intercept;\n\\(b_{0j}\\) is the random-effect of intercept for student \\(j\\);\n\\(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}\\) is a quantitative variable indicating grade-level,\n\\(\\beta_1\\) is the effect of a one-unit change in grade, and\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the error at time point \\(i\\) for student \\(j\\).\n\nThis is still referred to as the unconditional growth model since the only predictor is a fixed-effect of time.\n\n\nLookup Table: Mapping Categories to Quantities\nOne method to convert grade to a quantitative variable is to create a lookup table. A lookup table maps the levels of the categorical time predictor to the values we want to use in our new quantitative predictor. Below I create a lookup table to map the categorical time predictor to the relevant grade-level (grade_quant).\n\n# Create lookup table\nlookup_table = data.frame(\n  grade = c(\"vocab_08\", \"vocab_09\", \"vocab_10\", \"vocab_11\"),\n  grade_quant = c(8, 9, 10, 11)\n)\n\n# View lookup table\nlookup_table\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThen, we join (or merge) the tidy/long data with the lookup table. This adds the quantitative variables (with the correct mapping) to our tidy data. There are, of course, other ways to accomplish the same thing. For example a mutate() using the case_when() function could also be used to create this mapping.\n\n# Join the data with the lookup table\nvocabulary_long = vocabulary_long |>\n  left_join(lookup_table, by = \"grade\")\n\n# View data\nvocabulary_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn this join, we are adding records from the lookup_table data (right data) to the vocabulary_long data (left data).2 When we perform this left join, the final joined data will include all records from vcabulary_long (left dataset) but only those records from the lookup_table dataset whose key (grade value) is contained in the student data. For example, if the lookup_table data included information about a grade level that was not included in the vocabulary_long data, it would not appear in the joined data.\nThe {tidyverse} package includes six different join functions. You can read about four common join functions and see an animation illustrating them here."

    "section": "Centering the Time Predictor: Better Interpretations of the Intercept",
    "text": "Centering the Time Predictor: Better Interpretations of the Intercept\nOne method of improving the interpretations of the intercept is to center the time predictor. Recall that centering a variable means to add/subtract a constant value from each case. In a longitudinal analysis, we typically center the time predictor by subtracting the value of the time predictor at baseline (i.e., the first time point). In our example:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Centered~Grade}_{ij} = \\mathrm{Grade}_{ij} - 8\n\\]\nThis essentially maps the values of {8, 9, 10, 11} in the quant_grade variable to {0, 1, 2, 3}. Then we include this centered predictor as fixed-effect in the model. Mathematically, the model is:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Vocabulary~Score}_{ij}} = \\bigg[\\beta_0 + b_0\\bigg]  + \\beta_1(\\mathrm{Grade\\mbox{-}level}_{ij} - 8) + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nFitting this model:\n\n# Fit unconditional growth model with centered grade\nlmer.3 = lmer(vocab_score ~ 1 + I(grade_quant-8) + (1|id), data = vocabulary_long, REML = FALSE)\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lmer.3, effects = \"fixed\")\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe fitted equation is:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Vocabulary~Score}_{ij}} = 1.41 + 0.75(\\mathrm{Grade\\mbox{-}level}_{ij}-8)\n\\]\nInterpreting the coefficients,\n\nThe predicted average vocabulary score for 8th-grade students is 1.41. Centering removes the problem of extrapolation in the interpretation because we have now made 0 a legitimate value in the predictor.\nEach one-unit difference in grade-level is associated with a 0.75-point difference in vocabulary score, on average. This is identical to the previous model since we have not changed what a one-unit difference in the predictor represents.\n\nWe can see why the intercepts are different and the slopes are the same by comparing the plots of the individual growth profiles and the fitted fixed-effects models for the uncentered and centered predictors.\n\n\nCode\np1 = ggplot(data = vocabulary_long, aes(x = grade_quant, y = vocab_score)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = id), alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = -4.56, slope = 0.75, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(x = 0, y = -4.56, size = 1.5, color = \"blue\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Grade-level\",\n    limits = c(0, 11),\n    breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Vocabulary score\",\n    limits = c(-5, 10)\n    )\n\np2 = ggplot(data = vocabulary_long, aes(x = I(grade_quant-8), y = vocab_score)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = id), alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 1.41, slope = 0.75, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(x = 0, y = 1.41, size = 1.5, color = \"blue\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Centered grade-level (0 = 8th grade)\",\n    limits = c(0, 11),\n    breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Vocabulary score\",\n    limits = c(-5, 10)\n    )\n\n# Display plots\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot showing the change in vocabulary score over time for 64 students. The average growth profile is also displayed. This is shown for the non-centered (left) and 8th-grade centered (right) grade-level. A large blue point is shown at the intercept value in both plots.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the variance components:\n\n# SD\ntidy(lmer.3, effects = \"ran_pars\")\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Compute variance components\n1.784 ^ 2 #Between-students\n\n[1] 3.182656\n\n0.947 ^ 2 #Within-students\n\n[1] 0.896809\n\n\nComparing them to the unconditional random intercepts model:\nWithin-Student Variance (\\(\\hat\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\))\nThe unexplained variance that is within-students has decreased from 1.82 to 0.90. Including grade-level in the model has explained 50.8% of the within-student variation. This is because grade is a within-student predictor (it has values that vary within each student).\nBetween-Student Variance (\\(\\hat\\sigma^2_{0}\\))\nThe unexplained variance that is between-students has increased from 2.96 to 3.18. This means that by including grade in the model we have increased the amount of unexplained variation that is between students by 7.8%; a mathematical artifact of the estimation process.\nThese values are identical to the variance components obtained from the previous model. That is because the model we fitted is mostly identical to the uncentered quantitative model. The only difference is in the intercept value, which now is interpretable since a grade of 0 on the centered scale corresponds to the initial time point in the data; it is no longer extrapolation."

    "text": "Comparing the Unconditional Growth Models\nThe unconditional growth model was fitted using three different methods.\n\nThe first model treated time (grade) as categorical.\nThe second two models treated time as a continuous variable.\n\nTreating time continuously rather than as a categorical predictor has many advantages:\n\nIn the real-world time is continuous.\nThe model is simpler. In the model where time was treated categorically, we had to estimate four regression coefficients and two variance components. In the continuous models, we only had to estimate two regression coefficients and two variance components. If there were additional time points, we would still only need to estimate four parameters for the continuous model, but the number of estimates would increase for the categorical model.\nIt allows us to include participants being measured at different times.\nIt allows us to model nonlinear relationships more easily.\n\n\nIn general, you should always treat time continuously when you have a longitudinal study! This guidance also implies that you should use linear mixed-effects models rather than RM-ANOVA for the analysis of longitudinal data.\nMoreover, because of the interpretive value of the intercept when we center the grade-level predictor at the first time point, it is often a good idea to center your time predictor."

You will also learn how to expand the model to allow cases to have different growth rates. Lastly, you will learn how to include covariates to evaluate whether the average growth rates vary for different groups. To do so, we will use data from the file minneapolis.csv.\nWe will use these data to explore the change in students’ reading scores over time (i.e., is there longitudinal variation in students’ reading scores). As in most longitudinal analyses, our primary goal is to examine the mean change (i.e., pattern of growth) of the outcome over time.\nThe data are already in the long/tidy format, so we do not need to re-structure them. We will start the analysis by examining the average and individual growth profiles.\nFocusing on the average growth profile, it appears that the students’ average reading score gets higher over time, and that this change is fairly linear. We will next fit the unconditional random intercepts model (to get a baseline measure of the unaccounted for variation) and the unconditional linear growth model. In the latter model we center grade on the initial measurement occasion. We display the results from these fitted models in a table.\nFrom Model A we find that most of the unaccounted for variation in reading scores is between-student variation (84%). There is also unaccounted for variation at the within-student level. Model B includes the time-varying predictor of grade to explain within-student variation. This model explains 51.4% of the within-student variation, and \\(-2.2\\)% of the between-student variation (mathematical artifact). Below we write the global fitted equation and Student 1 and 2’s fitted equation based on the results of Model B.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathbf{Global:~} \\hat{\\mathrm{Reading~Score}}_{ij} &= 206 + 4.36(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij} - 5) \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathbf{Student~1:~} \\hat{\\mathrm{Reading~Score}}_{i1} &= 177 + 4.36(\\mathrm{Grade}_{i1} - 5) \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathbf{Student~2:~} \\hat{\\mathrm{Reading~Score}}_{i2} &= 201 + 4.36(\\mathrm{Grade}_{i2}-5 ) \\\\[1ex]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe coefficient interpretations from the global fitted equation are:\nThe unconditional growth model we fitted included a random-effect of intercept. This term accounted for the non-independence of reading scores in the data. It also allowed the student-specific equations to differ from the global equation in the intercept. That is, it allowed students to have different reading scores at the initial measurement occasion. Substantively, this implies that the reason an individual student has a higher (or lower) reading score than average is because their reading score at the initial measurement occasion was higher (or lower) than the average student.\nAnother reason that students might have a higher (or lower) reading score than average is because their growth rate is different than the average growth rate. The model we fitted did not allow students to have different growth rates than the average student. To evaluate whether we should allow this kind of flexibility in the model, we will focus on a plot of the individual student profiles to see whether they appear to have different rates-of-growth than the average profile."

The fact that this is negative indicates that students who have a lower random-effect of intercept tend to have a higher random-effect of grade In other words, students who have a lower reading score at the initial measurement occasion tend to have a higher growth rate.\nBelow, we add Model C to our table of regression results.\n\n\nCode\nhtmlreg(\n  l = list(lmer.a, lmer.b, lmer.c),\n  stars = numeric(0),    #No p-value stars\n  digits = 2,\n  padding = 20, #Add space around columns (you may need to adjust this via trial-and-error)\n  custom.model.names = c(\"Model A\", \"Model B\", \"Model C\"),\n  custom.coef.names = c(\"Intercept\", \"Grade\"),\n  reorder.coef = c(2, 1), #Put intercept at bottom of table\n  include.loglik = FALSE, #Omit log-likelihood\n  include.aic = FALSE,    #Omit AIC\n  include.bic = FALSE,    #Omit BIC\n  include.nobs = FALSE,   #Omit sample size\n  include.groups = FALSE, #Omit group size\n  include.deviance = TRUE,\n  custom.gof.names = c(\"Deviance\", \"Level-2 Variance (Intercept)\", \"Level-1 Variance\", \"Level-2 Variance (Slope)\", \"Level-2 Covariance\"), # Rename variance component rows\n  custom.gof.rows = list(\n    AICc = c(AICc(lmer.a), AICc(lmer.b), AICc(lmer.c))  # Add AICc values\n  ),\n  reorder.gof = c(3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 1),\n  caption = NULL,\n  caption.above = TRUE, #Move caption above table\n  inner.rules = 1, #Include line rule before model-level output\n  outer.rules = 1 , #Include line rules around table\n  custom.note = \"*Note.* The grade predictor was centered at the initial measurement occasion of 5th-grade.\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel A\n\n\nModel B\n\n\nModel C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\n\n\n \n\n\n4.36\n\n\n4.36\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.52)\n\n\n(0.70)\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n\n\n212.64\n\n\n206.09\n\n\n206.09\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(3.96)\n\n\n(4.04)\n\n\n(4.23)\n\n\n\n\nLevel-2 Variance (Intercept)\n\n\n329.66\n\n\n337.57\n\n\n381.44\n\n\n\n\nLevel-2 Variance (Slope)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.38\n\n\n\n\nLevel-2 Covariance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-19.12\n\n\n\n\nLevel-1 Variance\n\n\n61.62\n\n\n29.89\n\n\n17.59\n\n\n\n\nDeviance\n\n\n680.78\n\n\n633.02\n\n\n622.52\n\n\n\n\nAICc\n\n\n687.07\n\n\n641.50\n\n\n635.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.

This is because Model C includes an additional source of unexplained variation, namely \\(Var(b_1)\\) that the unconditional random intercepts model did not include.\nAs we add other fixed-effects predictors to the model, the variance components from those models could be compared to the variance components from Model C (so long as these models continue to include both the random intercepts and slopes). In other words, Model C becomes the new baseline model for other models that also include random intercepts and slopes."

We will control for attendance by setting it to its mean value. Note that since we mean centered attendance, this will drop the attendance term from the fitted equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathbf{Non\\mbox{-}SpEd:~}\\mathrm{Reading~Score}_{ij} &= 209 + 4.11(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}-5) - 22(0) + 218(0.9564 - 0.9564) + 1.89(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}-5)(0) \\\\[1ex]\n&= 209 + 4.11(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}-5) \\\\[4ex]\n\\mathbf{SpEd:~}\\mathrm{Reading~Score}_{ij} &= 209 + 4.11(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}-5) - 22(1) + 218(0.9564 - 0.9564) + 1.89(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}-5)(1) \\\\[1ex]\n&= 187 + 6.00(\\mathrm{Grade}_{ij}-5)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThis results in essentially the same plot as Model E (the special education students profile will have a slightly lower reading score in the 5th grade). The difference is now the profiles represent the growth in reading scores for special education and non special education students who have an average attendance. Student specific fitted equations would have to be computed using the student’s special education status and the student’s actual attendance, as well as their random-effects."

As with LM residual analysis, we want to examine the normality of the residuals in a density plot (or some other plot that allows you to evaluate this), and the other assumptions by plotting the residuals against the fitted values in a scatterplot.\n\n# Density plot of the level-1 residuals\np1 = ggplot(data = out_2, aes(x = .resid)) +\n  stat_density_confidence(model = \"normal\") +\n  stat_density(geom = \"line\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Level-1 residuals\")\n\n\n# Scatterplot of the Level-1 residuals versus the fitted values\np2 = ggplot(data = out_2, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Fitted values\") +\n  ylab(\"Level-1 residuals\")\n\n# Plot side-by-side\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Plots to evaluate the level-1 residuals.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots, the distributional assumptions for the Level-1 residuals seem reasonably satisfied. The density plot suggests that the normality assumption is tenable. The scatterplot shows symmetry around the \\(Y=0\\) line (average residual is 0), and that the data are consistent with the assumption of homoskedasticity."
