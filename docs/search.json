    "text": "Questions\n\nImport the data and display the first several rows of data (not all of it). Use one of the paged table options in your YAML to ensure that this is printed nicely. All syntax for these commands should be hidden.\nRecode the gni_class variable by creating a dummy variable called high_gni. To create this dummy variable use the syntax below. Explain in words (not code) how the high_gni dummy variable is being coded.\n\n\nfertility = fertility |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    high_gni = if_else(gni_class == \"Upper/Middle\" | gni_class == \"Upper\", 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\nCreate a well-formatted table that includes the mean infant mortality rate and the standard deviation of infant mortality rates for each of the two High GNI levels represented in the data. Display these in a summary table. All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption (the caption does not have to follow APA formatting). Do not display any syntax.\nUse the lm() function to fit a main effects linear model (unstandardized) regressing infant mortality on your dummy variable and female education level. Use the tidy() function from the broom package to display the model’s coefficient-level output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the model’s coefficient-level output.)\nUse a bulleted list to provide an interpretation of each estimated regression coefficient (including the intercept) from the regression you fitted in Question 3; one interpretation per list item.\nCreate a well-formatted table of the model’s coefficient tidy() output (e.g., using the gt() function from the {gt} package). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be “Predictor”, “B”, “SE”, “t”, and “p”, respectively. (The last four column names should be italicized since they are statistics.) All numerical output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the p-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add a caption. (2pts.)\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from the fitted model. For this plot, put the female education level predictor on the x-axis. Display separate lines to show the effects for each level of the dummy-coded GNI variable. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure includes a caption using the fig-cap option in the code chunk. The plot should be centered on the page. Adjust the aspect ratio of the plot using fig-width and fig-height in the code chunk so that it looks good. Lastly, change the values of the output width/height (out-width, out-height) to change the size of the plot from the default values. (2pts.)\nUse a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error and assumptions) using Greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from lm(). Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your document, and align the equals signs. (2pts.)\nWrite the following sentence: “The estimated partial regression coefficient (\\(\\hat\\beta_\\mathrm{Female~Education}\\)) is \\(x\\).” In this sentence, use an inline code chunk to replace \\(x\\) with the value for the fitted coefficient from the fitted equation. In this code chunk, do not just write in the value for the coefficient, but use syntax to extract the value from the tidy() output. (Hint: Google “R extract element from dataframe”.) (2pts.)\nCompute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the anova() function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, \\(\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\). Show the syntax you used in your document.\nWrite a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your document. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.) Both the BIB and CSL files should be included in your project’s assets directory. (2pts.)"

In this study, we will fit the same candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, however we will be using a different data set (e.g., our data includes more regions than Snipes and Taylor’s data). We will also make one change in the analysis, and that is we will treat vintage as a continuous variable; we won’t categorize it like Snipes and Taylor did. By using a different set of data and making slightly different analytic decisions we can more vigorously evaluate the underlying working hypotheses.\nFit the same nine candidate models that Snipes and Taylor fitted in their analysis, using the wine.csv data. In these models use wine rating (rating) as the outcome. Remember to treat vintage as a continuous variable in the models that include it.

    "text": "Effect of Religious Service Attendance\nYou will begin the analysis by examining the effect of religious service attendance on support of same-sex marriage. Because the data for this predictor come from a Likert scale (ordinal in nature), we need to examine whether we can treat it as a continuous predictor in the model, or whether we should treat it as categorical.\n\nBegin by computing the empirical proportion of people that support same-sex marriage for each of the attendance categories. Create a line plot that shows the relationship between proportion of support and attendance.\n\nBased on the plot you just created, the relationship between proportion of support and attendance seems linear. Because of this, we can treat the Likert data as continuous; using a line (or polynomial) to fit the relationship. The only caution being that when interpreting a slope, we say something like, “a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)-unit difference in \\(Y\\)”. For ordinal (Likert) data a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) really indicates a shift from one category to the next highest category.\n\nFit two logistic models to the data using religious service attendance. In the first model, only include the linear effect of attendance. In the second model, include both a linear and quadratic effect to predict variation in support for same-sex marriage. Which model should be adopted (linear or quadratic)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (Note: The model you adopt here will be henceforth referred to as Model 1.)\n\n\n\n\nWrite the fitted equation for Model 1. (Don’t forget to include all appropriate subscripts. Also define any terms in the model that are ambiguous.)\nUse the fitted equation for Model 1 to predict the (a) log-odds, (b) odds, and (c) probability of someone supporting same-sex marriage if that person attends religious services almost every week."

By referring to this matrix, clearly indicate the order in which you will add covariates into the model.\n\nFit three logistic models based on the order of importance of the three covariates that also include the effects of religious attendance, and denomination. For example, the first of these three models would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the most important covariate you identifed in Question 8. The second model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and the two most important covariates you identified. Finally, the third model would include the effects of religious attendance, denomination, and all three covariates.\n\nWhich of these three models should be adopted as you final model (or set of models)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision. (2pts.)\nCreate a table of results from your set of fitted models. This table should include Models 1–3 and also any model(s) you adopted from the previous question.

The two semester sequence provides in-depth coverage of widely used statistical methods and models and prepares students for advanced statistical coursework. EPsy 8251 provides rigorous coverage of estimation and hypothesis testing with a particular focus on the General Linear Model.\n\n\n\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another’s individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."

    "text": "Probability Density\nIn a continuous distribution we also need to account be able to talk about the fact that some outcomes are more likely than other outcomes. For example, in our standard normal distribution outcomes near zero are more probable than outcomes near 1, which are more probable than outcomes near 2, etc. Since we can’t use probability to do this (remember the probability of each outcome is the same, namely 0), we use something called probability density. This is akin to a relative probability, so outcomes with a higher probability density are more likely than outcomes with a lower probability density.\nThe mapping of all the outcomes to their probability densities is called a probability density function (PDF). Thus the equation or “bell-shaped” curve describing the standard normal distribution in Figure 1 is technically a PDF Here are some laws governing PDFs:\n\nProbability densities are always positive.\nThe probability of an outcome x between a and b equals the integral (area under the curve) between a and b of the probability density function. That is:\n\n\\[\np(a \\leq x \\leq b) = \\int_a^b p(x) dx\n\\]\n\nThe area under the curve from negative infinity to positive infinity is 1. That is:\n\n\\[\np(-\\infty \\leq x \\leq +\\infty) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} p(x) = 1\n\\]\nNext we will look at the PDF for a normal distribution."

    "text": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density\nThe function pnorm() computes the area under the PDF curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to some x-value. (Sometimes this is referred to as the cumulative probability density of x.) It is important to note that the PDF is defined such that the entire area under the curve is equal to 1. Because of this, we can also think about using area under the curve as an analog to probability in a continuous distribution.\nFor example, we might ask about the probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 given it is from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. Symbolically, we want to find:\n\\[\nP\\bigg(x \\leq 65 \\mid \\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\bigg)\n\\]\nThis is akin to finding the proportion of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) PDF that is to the left of 65. The figure below shows a graphical depiction of the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Create dataset\nfig_03 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = 10, to = 90, by = 0.01)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n    )\n\n# Filter out X&lt;=65\nshaded = fig_03 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &lt;= 65)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_03, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shaded, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"X\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. The area that is shaded grey (relative to the total area under the PDF) represents the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\n\n\nWe can compute the cumulative probability density using the pnorm() function. The “p” stand for “probability”.\n\n# Find P(x&lt;=65 | N(50,10) )\npnorm(q = 65, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n\nWe can interpret this as:\n\nThe probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 (if it is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) is 0.933.\n\nIn mathematics, the area under a curve is called an integral. The grey-shaded area in the previous figure can also be expressed as an integral of the probability density function:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{65} p(x) dx\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(x)\\) is the PDF for the normal distribution.\nThe most common application for finding the cumulative density is to compute a p-value. The p-value is just the area under the distribution (curve) that is AT LEAST as extreme as some observed value. For example, assume we computed a test statistic of \\(z=2.5\\), and were evaluating whether this was different from 0 (two-tailed test). Graphically, we want to determine the proportion of the area under the PDF that is shaded grey in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n# Create data\nfig_04 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n    )\n\n# Filter data for shading\nshade_01 = fig_04 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &gt;= 2.5)\n\nshade_02 = fig_04 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &lt;= -2.5)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_04, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_01, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_02, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"z\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for the standard normal distribution (\\(M=0\\), \\(SD=1\\)). The cumulative density representing the p-value for a two-tailed test evaluating whether \\(\\mu=0\\) using an observed mean of 2.5 is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the distribution of the test statistic is normally distributed, we can use pnorm() to compute the p-value. If we assume the test statistic, z, has been scaled to use standardized units, the standard deviation we use in pnorm() will be sd=1. The mean is based on the value being tested in the null hypothesis. In most null hypotheses, we are testing a difference from 0 (e.g., \\(H_0: \\mu=0\\), \\(H_0: \\beta=0\\)), so we would use mean=0 in the pnorm() function.\nRemember, pnorm() computes the proportion of the area under the curve TO THE LEFT of a particular value. Here we will compute the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) and then double it to produce the actual p-value. (We can double it because the normal distribution is symmetric so the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) is the same as the area to the right of \\(+2.5\\).)\n\n# Compute the p-value based on z=2.5\n2 * pnorm(q = -2.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.01241933\n\n\nWe interpret this p-value as:\n\nThe probability of observing a statistic at least as extreme as 2.5, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 0.012. This is evidence against the null hypothesis since the data are inconsistent with the assumed hypothesis.\n\n\n\nqnorm(): Computing Quantiles\nThe qnorm() function is essentially the inverse of the pnorm() function. The pnorm() function computes the cumulative probability GIVEN a particular quantile (x-value). The qnorm() function computes the quantile GIVEN a cumulative probability. For example, in the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) distribution, half of the area under the PDF is below the x-value (quantile) of 50.\nTo use the qnorm() function to give the x-value (quantile) that defines the lower 0.5 of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) PDF, the syntax would be:\n\n# Find the quantile that has a cumulative density of 0.5 in the N(50, 10) distribution\nqnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\n\nrnorm(): Generating Random Observations\nThe rnorm() function can be used to generate random observations drawn from a specified normal distribution. Aside from the mean= and sd= arguments, we also need to specify the number of observations to generate by including the argument n=. For example, to generate 15 observations drawn from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution we would use the following syntax:\n\n# Generate 15 observations from N(50,10)\nset.seed(100)\nrnorm(n = 15, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n [1] 44.97808 51.31531 49.21083 58.86785 51.16971 53.18630 44.18209 57.14533\n [9] 41.74741 46.40138 50.89886 50.96274 47.98366 57.39840 51.23380\n\n\nThe set.seed() function sets the state of the random number generator used in R so that the results are reproducible. If you don’t use set.seed() you will get a different set of observations each time you run rnorm(). Here we set the starting seed to 100, but you can set this to any integer you want."

In our example, this ratio is 41.6; on average the model explains 41.6 times the variation that is unexplained.\nNote that this is an identical computation (although reframed) as the initial computation for F.

    "section": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates",
    "text": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates\nMean squares are also estimates of the variance. Consider the computational formula for the sample variance,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum(Y - \\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nThis is the total sum of squares divided by the total df. The variance of the outcome variable is interpreted as the average amount of variation in the outcome variable (in the squared metric). Thus, it is also referred to as the mean square total.\nWhen we compute an F-statistic, we are finding the ratio of two different variance estimates—one based on the model (explained variance) and one based on the error (unexplained variance). Under the null hypothesis that \\(\\rho^2 = 0\\), we are assuming that all the variance is unexplained. In that case, our F-statistic would be close to zero. When the model explains a significant amount of variation, the numerator gets larger relative to the denominator and the F-value is larger.\nThe mean squared error (from the anova() output) plays a special role in regression analysis. It is the variance estimate for the conditional distributions of the residuals in our visual depiction of the distributional assumptions of the residuals underlying linear regression.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Visual Depiction of the Distributional Assumptions of the Residuals Underlying Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we made implicit assumptions about the conditional distributions of the residuals, namely that they were identically and normally distributed with a mean of zero and some variance. Based on the estimate of the mean squared error, the variance of each of these distributions is 58.5.\nWhile the variance is a mathematical convenience, the standard deviation is often a better descriptor of the variation in a distribution since it is measured in the original metric. The standard deviation fro the residuals (error) is 7.6. Because the residuals are statistics (summaries computed from sample data), their standard deviation is referred to as a “standard error”.\n\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is sometimes referred to as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n\n# Compute RMSE\nsqrt(58.5)\n\n[1] 7.648529\n\n\nWhy is this value important? It gives the expected variation in the conditional residual distributions, which is a measure of the average amount of error. For example, since all of the conditional distributions of the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed, we would expect that 95% of the residuals would fall between \\(\\pm2\\) standard errors from 0; or, in this case, between \\(-15.3\\) and \\(+15.3\\). Observations with residuals that are more extreme may be regression outliers.\nMore importantly, it is a value that we need to estimate in order to specify the model."

Namely,\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Confidence~Level} = 1 - \\alpha\n\\]\nSo, if you use \\(\\alpha=.05\\), then the confidence level would be \\(.95\\), and we would call this a 95% confidence interval.

    "text": "Course Requirements\nStudents will complete eight homework assignments. The homework assignments and due dates will be posted on the Assignments page of the course website. These assignments include problems that will help you learn the course material through reflection and practice. Submit each assignment as a PDF file via email to the TA.\nTo foster cooperation and collaboration, you are permitted to form groups of no larger than three to work on the homework. Submit only one assignment per group, and list the names of each group member on the assignment. Each assignment will be scored and this score will be given to all individuals in the group. From past experience, student collaborations work most fluidly when everyone in the group has chosen the same grading option for the course (e.g., A/F, S/N, etc.).\nIf you work alone on the assignments, you need to truly work alone. To protect against running afoul of the scholastic dishonesty policy, students working alone are not permitted to interact with any other student in regards to the assignment, including discussion, obtaining help, etc.\n\n\nEvaluation of Student Performance\nCourse grades will be based entirely on performance on the homework assignments. The points from the eight homework assignment will be pooled to compute a percentage in the class, which will be converted to a final course grade using:\n\n\n\nCutoff\nGrade\nCutoff\nGrade\nCutoff\nGrade\n\n\n\n\n93%\nA\n83%\nB\n73%\nC\n\n\n90%\nA–\n80%\nB–\n70%\nC–\n\n\n87%\nB+\n77%\nC+\n63%\nD\n\n\n\nStudents who earn below 63% will receive the letter grade of F. If you are taking the course S/N, the minimum criterion to receive an S is 80% (the equivalent of a B– letter grade). Any student who does not complete all homework assignments without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.\n\n\n\nIncomplete\nAn incomplete will be assigned only in extraordinary circumstances (e.g., hospitalization). An incomplete is an arranged grade which requires a written contract between instructor and student that includes by when and how the incomplete will be satisfied. Incomplete contract forms are available at https://z.umn.edu/incompletegradecontract or from program staff in 250 EdSciB.\n\n\n\nAccessing Course Grades\nShortly after the course, you may access your grades online at myU. Assignments will be handed back in class or during office hours. Uncollected assignments will be retained for six weeks after the course and then discarded.\n\n\n\nStress Management\nStress management is an important piece of the skill set needed for success in graduate school. Pet Away Worry & Stress (PAWS) is one of the many resources available to students. Find out more at https://boynton.umn.edu/paws.\n\nYou can follow Tilly the Therapy Chicken on Twitter (@TherapyChicken)."

    "text": "Statistical Computing\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 8251. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS https://www.r-project.org. It should be noted that while some R syntax and programming is taught during class time, there is also a fair amount that you may need to learn on your own outside of class. There are several tutorials and resources linked from the course website to help you learn R.\nYou can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (There are instructions for how to do this on the course website.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies—including printer trouble—will not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy’s limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."

    "section": "Course Requirements and Grading",
    "text": "Course Requirements and Grading\nStudents will complete eight homework assignments. The homework assignments and due dates will be posted on the Assignments page of the course website. These assignments include problems that will help you learn the course material through reflection and practice. Submit each assignment as a PDF file via email to the TA.\nTo foster cooperation and collaboration, you are permitted to form groups of no larger than three to work on the homework. Submit only one assignment per group, and list the names of each group member on the assignment. Each assignment will be scored and this score will be given to all individuals in the group. From past experience, student collaborations work most fluidly when everyone in the group has chosen the same grading option for the course (e.g., A/F, S/N, etc.).\nIf you work alone on the assignments, you need to truly work alone. To protect against running afoul of the scholastic dishonesty policy, students working alone are not permitted to interact with any other student in regards to the assignment, including discussion, obtaining help, etc.\n\n\nPolicy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work\nStudents are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to University Policy. If you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment.\n\nIf you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Student Performance\nCourse grades will be based entirely on performance on the homework assignments. The points from the eight homework assignment will be pooled to compute a percentage in the class, which will be converted to a final course grade using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutoff\nGrade\nDefinition for Graduate Credit\n\n\n\n\n93%–100%\nA\nFor exceptional work, well above the minimum criteria\n\n\n90%–92%\nA–\nFor outstanding work, well above the minimum criteria\n\n\n87%–89%\nB+\nFor excellent work, significant above the minimum criteria\n\n\n83%–86%\nB\nFor work above the minimum criteria\n\n\n80%–82%\nB–\n\n\n\n77%–79%\nC+\n\n\n\n73%–76%\nC\nFor work which meets the course requirements in every respect\n\n\n70%–72%\nC–\n\n\n\n63%–69%\nD\nWorthy of credit even though it fails to meet the course requirements\n\n\n0%–62%\nF\nFailed to meet minimum course requirements\n\n\n\nIf you are taking the course S/N, the minimum criterion to receive an S is 80% (the equivalent of a B– letter grade). The S grade does not carry grade points and is not part of the GPA calculation, but the credits will count toward the student’s degree program if allowed by the college, campus, or program.\nAny student who does not complete all homework assignments without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.\n\n\n\nIncomplete\nInstructors may assign the registration symbol “I” for Incomplete if, at the time the incomplete is requested: (1) the student has successfully completed a substantial portion of the work of the course; and (2) due to extraordinary circumstances (as determined by the instructor), the student was prevented from completing the work of the course on time. The assignment of an “I” requires a written agreement with the student specifying the time and manner in which the student will complete the course requirements. For more information see Grading and Transcripts.\n\n\n\nAccessing Course Grades\nShortly after the course, you may access your grades online at myU. Assignments will be handed back in class or during office hours. Uncollected assignments will be retained for six weeks after the course and then discarded.\n\n\n\nStress Management\nStress management is an important piece of the skill set needed for success in graduate school. Pet Away Worry & Stress (PAWS) is one of the many resources available to students. Find out more at https://boynton.umn.edu/paws.\n\nYou can follow Tilly the Therapy Chicken on Twitter (@TherapyChicken)."

As everyday businesses moved online, city council meetings or court proceedings became near-inaccessible to anyone whose connection couldn’t support a Zoom call.”\n\nBut, who in America has access to broadband internet? As part of their ongoing work to improve software and service performance and security, Microsoft collected router speed data from individuals who accessed their cloud services. After aggregating and anonomyzing these data, they made these data available publicly to help researchers and policymakers understand and improve problems related to broadband access.\nThe data in broadband.csv, collected by Microsoft (2021), give us much better insight as to the true broadband access (defined as internet download speeds of at least 25 Mbps) of Americans as, to date, most studies of broadband access have use data collated by the FCC that is based on individual Internet Service Providers’ descriptions of the areas they serve.
