**Required**

Read the following:

- Osborne, Jason (2002). [Notes on the use of data transformations](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/pare/vol8/iss1/6/). *Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation, 8*(6).

<br />


**Additional Resources**

In addition to the notes and what we cover in class, there are many other resources for learning about log-transformations. Here are some resources that may be helpful in that endeavor:


- [UCLA IDRE: Interpreting Log-Transformed Variables in Regression ](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-do-i-interpret-a-regression-model-when-some-variables-are-log-transformed/)
- [Interpret Regression Coefficient Estimates](http://www.cazaar.com/ta/econ113/interpreting-beta)
