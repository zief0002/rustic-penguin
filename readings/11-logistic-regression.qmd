**Additional Resources**

In addition to the notes and what we cover in class, there are many other resources for learning about logistic regression models. Here are some resources that may be helpful in that endeavor:

- Dunteman, G. H., &amp; Ho, M.-H. R. (2005). [An introduction to generalized linear models.](https://primo.lib.umn.edu/permalink/f/11uk8fo/UMN_ALMA51699489010001701) Sage.
