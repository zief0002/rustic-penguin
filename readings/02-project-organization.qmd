Before next class, look at your computer files and your organization of those files. Here are some things to reflect on:

- Are your files organized into folders/directories? Or are they all in your Downloads folder?
  + How did you organize all the data files, notes, etc. from EPsy 8251?
- If I asked you to find a specific file, could you locate it without using "Search"?
- Can you tell what is in a particular file by just looking at its name?
- Do your file names contain spaces? What about characters that aren't letters, numbers, dashes, or underscores?
- Are your file names consistent (all lower case letters, or all title case)? Or are they all different?
